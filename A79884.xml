            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>TO THE READER.</head>
                  <p>THere are but one or two things (by way of Preface) that I ſhall trouble the Reader withal, in his paſſage to the enſuing Diſcourſe; and they relate partly to the Pedigree, and partly to the Age of this expoſed Birth. When as the Ceremonies, (thoſe Dregs of <hi>Romiſh</hi> Superſtition, and Troublers of our Nation) which for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers years together ſeemed to be <hi>dead</hi> (and were taken by many to be <hi>deadly</hi>) began to be revived again, and preſſed with more eagerneſs and fierceneſs than ever; ſo that now there was no room left for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, but every Miniſter muſt either pay the whole (I cannot ſay, <hi>Debt,</hi> but) demanded Conformity, even to the leaſt mite, and laſt farthing, or become Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt;
<pb facs="tcp:137166:3"/>it highly behoved every one to caſt up his accounts, and conſider with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, whether he were <hi>ſolvendo par,</hi> and could with a good conſcience defray the great and extraordinary charges of ſuch an intire Compliance, as was required; or whether he muſt not be conſtrained (in ſuch a ſtorm) to throw over-board, not only <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>(Mark 12.44.) all his living,</hi> to redeem and ſecure the life of his ſoul and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. On the one hand, the <hi>Avengers</hi> of the <hi>blood</hi> of their <hi>Diana</hi>-Ceremonies, purſued the ſcent ſo hotly, that there was no poſſibility of eſcaping for any one who did not take ſanctuary at their Altars: The ſtorm was ſo impetuous and outragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as threatned inevitable ruine (as to all outward concerns) to every one who did not ſhelter himſelf under the Act of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity, and ſwim along with the ſtream that way that the Wind and Tide carried him. On the other hand, there ſeemed to be ſuch Gulfs, and Shelves, and Rocks, as threatned evident ſhipwrack of a good conſcience, or endanger'd drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the paſſage and practice of what was enjoyned: So that it was the great
<pb facs="tcp:137166:3"/>concernment of every one that would look to the end of his Voyage, that is, beyond theſe temporal things, to thoſe that are eternal, and would ſecure his intereſt in another world, to look about him, and to take care that he did <hi>not condemn himſelf</hi> (in his judgment) <hi>in that thing which he allowed</hi> (in his practice), but to be fully perſwaded and ſatisfied in his own mind, that ſo he might not act <hi>doubtingly,</hi> but in <hi>faith,</hi> as is required, <hi>Rom. 14.22, 23.</hi> This poſture of affairs put me upon an impartial Examination and Conſideration of what was alledged on both ſides; and finding that the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the caſe in general (beſides the conſideration of particulars) depended chiefly upon theſe Points handled in the following Diſcourſe (for if the command of Authority does not alter the nature of things, and render that neceſſary, which before was but indifferent, then (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their own principles) the Law of Scandal takes hold of me, and I am bound not to do that, at which another is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended. And again, If that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded remain ſtill indifferent, then I am bound alſo to aſſert my Chriſtian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and not tamely to give it up (<hi>Iſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>char</hi>-like)
<pb facs="tcp:137166:4"/>and ſo make my ſelf a ſervant, yea a ſlave of men, by my own conſent and voluntary act;) Thereupon I enter'd upon a more narrow ſearch of theſe Principles, (as I may call them), and upon the whole, I came to that reſult and iſſue in my thoughts, which I have Tranſcribed into theſe Papers.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the point of <hi>Scandal,</hi> though many have travel'd in the ſame way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me; yet they have left ſuch hedges and ditches behind them, that would put a man either to a ſtand, that he can go no further, or to a leap, or to a turn, to get over, or paſs by them. Theſe I have endeavoured to level (for I am a great friend to ſuch levelling) and to make every thing as ſmooth and plain as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly I could; and likewiſe to lay down ſuch general Rules, as may lead us to a determination of ſuch other caſes of the ſame nature as may occur. Theſe things were then ſcribled (and ſome of them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in a publick Auditory, before that fatal blow was given, <hi>Aug. 24.62.</hi>) and have lain in obſcurity ever ſince; and whether they are happily or unhappily now brought forth, and expoſed to publick view, the event muſt determine.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:137166:4"/>
                  <p>I have but one word more, and that's a word of Requeſt (and I think a very reaſonable one) <hi>viz.</hi> That the Reader will be ſo charitable, as to believe that it was purely the powerfully convincing evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Truth ſhining in my eyes, that inclined me (like a ſtrong Bias) to run counter to my own intereſt. And ſurely he muſt be highly uncharitable, that can imagine that any one perſon (much leſs a conſiderable number of perſons of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exceptionable Morals, and in all other reſpects ſerious and ſober) ſhould be ſo deſperately bent upon his own undoing, as to ſhut his eyes againſt the light, and refuſe to admit of truths of ſuch comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table importance as theſe, tending to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, are of. <hi>Vale.</hi>

To eat them thus, was to eat them under the very <hi>notion</hi> and <hi>formality</hi> of an Idol-ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and ſo was a plain honouring of the Idol, and might eaſily be interpreted an <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment</hi> of their Deity, and an <hi>approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of that Idolatrous worſhip and ſervice which was given them.

                  <p>Thus much may ſerve for the preſent ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the point, to keep it from ſinking (in your thoughts) while we open the three prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal ſpurs or roots of it, by taking a ſurvey of the Nature (1) of Chriſtian Liberty; as to this particular; (2) Of Things Indifferent; (3) Of Scandal; all rugged, thorny, and diſputable points, for each of them has ſome <hi>incumbrance</hi> upon it; ſome conſiderable dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty attending it, which will render our paſſage thorow them the more operoſe and troubleſome.

                  <p n="1">1. What our <hi>Liberty</hi> is <hi>in things indifferent,</hi> which we muſt not make uſe of to the ſcandal and offence of others.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. What the nature of theſe <hi>Indifferencies</hi> are wherein we have this liberty.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. What the nature of that <hi>Scandal</hi> is, for which we muſt forbear the uſe of our liberty in theſe Indifferencies.</p>
                  <p>And firſt for the firſt,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="i."/> what our <hi>Liberty</hi> is <hi>in things indifferent.</hi> This Liberty, as it is a freedom from the Moſaical Pedagogy and Ceremonies, is one branch of <hi>Chriſtian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</hi> Now that we may the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:137166:12"/>the nature of <hi>Liberty</hi> as <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> i. e. belonging to us as Chriſtians, in oppoſition to, and contradiſtinction from the <hi>Jews,</hi> we ſhall a little reflect upon <hi>Jewiſh</hi> bondage to ſee what that was; for, as they ſay, <hi>Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> are the beſt <hi>Commentaries,</hi> and their <hi>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual oppoſition,</hi> the moſt <hi>effectual expoſition.</hi> Of <hi>Jewiſh bondage,</hi> theſe were two principal branches.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A numerous train of external Rites and Ceremonious obſervances, which lay like a <hi>mask</hi> or <hi>folded vail</hi> upon the <hi>fair face</hi> of <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual worſhip,</hi> ſo that they could ſcarce ſee <hi>wood for trees,</hi> diſcern the inward beauty thereof; or were like the pictures in a book, which children look moſtly at, not regarding the ſenſe. Now this was a burden and <hi>yoke,</hi> which <hi>galled</hi> their <hi>necks,</hi> and almoſt broke their backs,
<note place="margin">Act. 15.10.</note> ſo that they were <hi>not able to bear it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>reſtraint</hi> that lay upon them in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to certain <hi>meats, days,</hi> and other things in their own nature <hi>indifferent;</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which it was ſaid unto them, <hi>Touch not, taſte not, handle not,</hi> &amp;c. whereby their <hi>hands</hi> were <hi>tied,</hi> and their <hi>mouths gagg'd,</hi> and a <hi>knife ſet to their throats;</hi> and ſo their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty was reſtrain'd, and they were brought into bondage and thraldom thereby. Now <hi>Chriſtian Liberty</hi> ſnaps aſunder the bonds of both theſe Impoſitions; For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It has diſcharged the Ceremonies from
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:137166:13"/>any further attendance upon the worſhip of God, and admitted only a few plainer (in the two Sacraments of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Lords Supper</hi>) into their rooms; ſo that true Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-worſhippers do <hi>worſhip God in ſpirit and in truth,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 4.23.</note> eminently over what they did then.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That Ceremonial reſtraint is alſo now taken off, which lay upon the uſe of indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent things (which is the particular under preſent conſideration) which to us Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans God has <hi>cleanſed</hi> (<hi>Act.</hi> 10.15.) and made <hi>pure,</hi> (<hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15.) and given us <hi>freely to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy,</hi> (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.17.) and therefore <hi>nothing is now to be refuſed,</hi> (viz. upon any ſuch ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count), (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.4.) And this <hi>Liberty</hi> we are bound ſtrenuouſly to aſſert and ſtand faſt in, not ſuffering our ſelves to be again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled with this yoke, (<hi>Gal.</hi> 5.1.) nor ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting our ſelves to any humane <hi>Ordinances,</hi> either by way of <hi>Doctrine</hi> or <hi>Command,</hi> not to <hi>touch, taſte, handle,</hi> &amp;c. (<hi>Col.</hi> 2.20-22.) whereby any tye ſhould lye upon us for a total and univerſal abſtinence from any of the good creatures of God.</p>
                  <p>So then, <hi>Chriſtian Liberty</hi> allows a free uſe of things indifferent.</p>
                  <p>But now, notwithſtanding this <hi>general</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, there may be a <hi>particular, occaſional,</hi> and <hi>accidental reſtraint</hi> of this liberty, <hi>pro hic &amp; nunc,</hi> upon ſeveral occaſions, and in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral caſes: As,</p>
                  <p n="1">(1) In caſe of <hi>Scandal to our ſelves,</hi> if we
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:137166:13"/>find them ſnares, and occaſions of ſin to us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.29. <hi>If thy right eye offend thee,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p n="2">(2) In caſe of <hi>Scandal to others,</hi> when it gives offence to them, and <hi>wounds their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi> Gal. 5.13. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe not liberty for an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the fleſh, but by love ſerve one another.</hi> i. e. So uſe your <hi>liberty,</hi> as may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with <hi>Charity.</hi> (But of this more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after).</p>
                  <p n="3">(3) In caſe of a <hi>Vow,</hi> or <hi>Oath,</hi> or ſuch like <hi>Engagement,</hi> Deut 23.23. <hi>That which is gone out of thy lips, thou ſhalt keep and perform.</hi> Wherein yet Chriſtians ſhould be very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful that they don't unneceſſarily intangle themſelves.</p>
                  <p n="4">(4) In caſe of <hi>Competition,</hi> or <hi>Interfering</hi> with any neceſſary duty. It was free for the <hi>Jews</hi> to offer what they pleaſed for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Temple; but if their parents ſtood in need of it (their relief being a neceſſary duty) it was a fruſtrating God's Command, to uſe their liberty in that caſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.4-6.</p>
                  <p n="5">(5) In caſe of <hi>Scruple</hi> or <hi>Prejudice,</hi> when Conſcience either <hi>condemns,</hi> Rom. 14.14.— <hi>To him that eſteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean;</hi> or <hi>doubts</hi> of the lawfulneſs of ſuch a practice, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.23.—<hi>Whatſoever is not of faith</hi> (i. e. of a perſwaſion that it is
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:137166:14"/>either <hi>preſcribed,</hi> or <hi>permitted</hi> by God, and ſo lawful to be done) <hi>is ſin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">(6) In caſe of a <hi>juſt Prohibition</hi> by Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 2.36. <hi>And the King ſaid unto Shimei, Build thee an houſe in Jeruſalem, and dwell there, and go not forth thence any whither.</hi> Jer. 35.6. <hi>But they ſaid, We will drink no wine; for Jonadab the ſon of Rechab our father com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us, ſaying, Ye ſhall drink no wine, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ye, nor your ſons for ever.</hi> Which pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of theirs was not only <hi>allowed,</hi> but <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded</hi> by God, as may be ſeen, <hi>v.</hi> 18, 19.</p>
                  <p>Now here lies the difficulty in this point of Chriſtian Liberty in indifferent things.</p>
                  <p>Whether a reſtraint laid upon an indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent thing meerly by humane authority, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Dub. </seg>
                     </label> be an infringement of, and encroachment upon, Chriſtian Liberty?</p>
                  <p>This is a <hi>hard knot,</hi> which generally all that I have met with, have (in my apprehenſion) rather <hi>cut aſunder,</hi> than <hi>untied.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some will have Chriſtian Liberty herein, to conſiſt both in <hi>Liberty of judgement and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice;</hi> and that, <hi>If what Chriſt has left free do not ſtill remain as free as Chriſt left it, and we yield to it, and comply accordingly; this is not to ſtand faſt in the liberty wherewith Chriſt has made us free.</hi> So the Author of <hi>Beams of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Light,</hi> p. 69, 70. The common Doctrine is, That Determination of the Practice, does not prejudice Chriſtian Liberty. Thus <hi>P.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:137166:14"/>Martyr in Cor. De adiaphoris, libertas in animo retinenda eſt, non in actione.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Serm. p. 589. 4to. and ſo, <hi>De Conſc.</hi> p. 211, &amp;c.</note> And ſo Dr. <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſon. The liberty of a Chriſtian to any thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different conſiſts in this, That his judgement is thorowly perſwaded of the indifferency of it; and therefore it is the Determination of the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the opinion of the thing, not in the uſe of it, that takes away Chriſtian Liberty.</hi> So others. But I muſt needs profeſs my unſatisfiedneſs with this diſtinction, as not being, to my apprehenſion, ſufficiently countenanc'd by Scripture, but rather diſown'd; and for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſons alſo which follow afterwards.</p>
                  <p>If I may have leave to try my skill for the untying of this knot, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Sol. </seg>
                     </label> I ſhall offer my thoughts, and make <hi>payment</hi> of what is <hi>due</hi> to this queſtion (at leaſt, my <hi>ſhot</hi> and <hi>ſhare</hi> of it) in theſe ſeveral <hi>Sums</hi> following.</p>
                  <p>Prop. 1. 'Tis certain, that <hi>Civil Subjection, and Obedience to Magiſtrates, and Chriſtian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty do very well conſiſt together.</hi> There's a friendly correſpondence between them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any jarring or diſcord. There are places of Scripture which plainly enjoyn the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of both theſe. On the one hand, <hi>Civil Subjection,</hi> Rom. 13.1. <hi>Let every ſoul be ſubject to the higher powers.</hi> On the other hand, <hi>ſtanding to our Chriſtian Liberty,</hi> Gal. 5.1. <hi>Stand faſt in the Liberty wherewith Chriſt has made us free.</hi> Nay, there's one place ſeems to joyn and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:137166:15"/>marry them both together, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit your ſelves to every ordinance of man</hi> (i. e. to all ſorts of Magiſtrates; ſo called, becauſe they are of mens ſetting up, are for mens good; and the particular form uſually left to mens choice and determination) <hi>for the Lords ſake.</hi> And leſt any ſhould object, That this were to prejudice our <hi>Chriſtian, Liberty;</hi> he adds, <hi>v.</hi> 16. <hi>As free,</hi> which both <hi>Chryſ.</hi> and <hi>Oecumenius</hi> joyn with the word <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,</hi> v. 13. as if he had ſaid, We may ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our ſelves, and yet be free too; we may be
<note n="(a)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Bonus, etiamſi ſerviat, liber eſt: malus autem eti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amſi regnet, ſervus eſt; nec unius hominis, ſed, quod gravius eſt, tot Dominorum, quot vitiorum.</hi> Aug. de C. D. l. 4. c. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>obedient Subjects,</hi> and yet <hi>free Chriſtians.</hi> Submiſſion to every Ordinance of man, and Chriſtian freedom are not inconſiſtent.</p>
                  <p>Prop. 2. <hi>Chriſtian Liberty lies originally in the judgement:</hi> In accounting and judging thoſe things about which it is converſant, or wherein it does conſiſt, to be neither commanded nor forbidden by God. The reaſon whereof is, Becauſe the <hi>Practice</hi> depends altogether upon this; ſo that if the <hi>judgement</hi> be once leven'd with errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous principles concerning theſe things, then the <hi>Practice</hi> is for ever reſtrain'd, and ſo the whole being of <hi>Chriſtian Liberty</hi> quite loſt and deſtroy'd. Whereas, when the <hi>judgement</hi> is rightly informed, though in ſome caſes <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:137166:15"/>of Practice</hi> may be reſtrain'd, yet in all others it remains entire. And therefore, though in ſeveral caſes we may part with <hi>Liberty of Practice</hi> (as has been ſhew'd), yet we muſt be ſure to preſerve <hi>Liberty of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> entire, and <hi>ſtand faſt</hi> in that. Which, I conceive, was one main reaſon (and not, becauſe <hi>Chriſtian Liberty</hi> did conſiſt only therein, as
<note place="margin">* <hi>Stillingfl. Iren.</hi> p. 58.</note> a very learned Writer ſuppoſes) that <hi>Paul</hi> was ſo zealous in aſſerting and contending for <hi>Liberty of Judgement,</hi> and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing thoſe who went about to impoſe a <hi>Doctrinal</hi> neceſſity of obſerving Judaical Rites and Ceremonies, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.4, 5. Whereas in matter of <hi>Practice</hi> he does occaſionally yield in that, out of tenderneſs towards weak Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and compliance with them for their good. Yet,</p>
                  <p>Prop. 3. <hi>Chriſtian Liberty is not confin'd only to the Judgement:</hi> It does not conſiſt only in Liberty of Judgement; ſo that if that be left free, the <hi>Practice</hi> may be <hi>totally</hi> and <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally reſtrain'd,</hi> without any poſſibility of a <hi>breach of Liberty</hi> thereby. But, <hi>Chriſtian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi> extends to the <hi>Practice</hi> alſo; ſo that <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Practice</hi> is a branch of <hi>Chriſtian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,</hi> as well as <hi>Liberty of Judgement.</hi> You ſhall find the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> condemns the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint of the <hi>Practice,</hi> as being a violation of their liberty, and a returning again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to bondage, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.9, 10. <hi>Ye obſerve days,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:137166:16"/>and months,</hi> &amp;c. Col. 2.20, 21. <hi>Why are yè ſubject to Ordinances? Touch not,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>i. e.</hi> Why do you <hi>dance</hi> after their <hi>pipe, tune</hi> your <hi>Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> to their <hi>Tongues,</hi> and conform your <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice</hi> to their <hi>Precepts</hi> and Doctrines? You ought not to do ſo: It's a renouncing of your intereſt in <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Death. Beſides, Do you think a Magiſtrate might now forbid his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects the uſe of all thoſe things which God made unclean by the Ceremonial Law, though he left their Judgements free? or command the uſe of all thoſe Rites then eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, though not upon a <hi>ſacred,</hi> but a <hi>civil</hi> account?</p>
                  <p>Prop. 4. <hi>The meer determination of the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, quatenus determination, doth not infringe our Liberty;</hi> for then it might not juſtly be determin'd in any caſe whatſoever; but it may juſtly be determin'd in ſome caſes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out breach of liberty, <hi>viz.</hi> in the caſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned. The reaſon whereof is, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe things in ſuch a caſe, put off <hi>(pro hic &amp; nunc)</hi> the nature of indifferency, and become neceſſary, and ſo lye without the verge and bounds of Liberty. But,</p>
                  <p>Prop. 5. <hi>A needleſs and unneceſſary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation of this Liberty of Practice, is the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and formal breach of it.</hi> Not meerly the <hi>Determination,</hi> as was ſaid, but the <hi>needleſneſs</hi> of it, <hi>i. e.</hi> when there is no reaſon at all for
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:137166:16"/>it, but meerly the Determiners will. My reaſon is, Becauſe it is an <hi>unjuſt</hi> reſtraint of our liberty (as being made without reaſon, which is the rule and foundation of Juſtice), and therefore, a breach of our liberty.</p>
                  <p>There's a <hi>twofold goodneſs</hi> or <hi>neceſſity, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecal,</hi> or <hi>general,</hi> engraven in the nature of things by ſome divine Command, natural or poſitive; as to pray, read, be diligent in our callings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Extrinſecal, Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial,</hi> or <hi>Particular,</hi> ariſing only from circumſtances; as, to take Phyſick when I am ſick, to recreate my ſelf when I am tired out and wearied with the Duties of my particular calling, to have a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent place for the publick Aſſemblies of the Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now every lawful humane conſtitution muſt have one of theſe to vouch and warrant it. It muſt be grounded either upon the <hi>Intrinſecal goodneſs</hi> of the thing; and therefore that is a lawful Conſtitution which enjoyns perſons to aſſemble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves together on the Lord's day for the publick and ſolemn worſhip of God. Or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome <hi>Extrinſecal</hi> and <hi>Circumſtantial</hi> good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and therefore that is a lawful Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, which prohibits the Exportation of Wool, becauſe it would deprive the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of a great part of their maintenance about dreſſing and ordering of it; and that is a good Law which provides for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency of place; <hi>&amp;c.</hi> about publick wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:137166:17"/>But otherwiſe, thoſe Laws which have neither ſuch an <hi>intrinſecal,</hi> nor <hi>circumſtantial goodneſs,</hi> have not the due and
<note n="(a)" place="margin">
                        <hi>We muſt diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween an</hi> indifferency <hi>as to its</hi> nature, <hi>and</hi> indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, <hi>as to its</hi> uſe <hi>and</hi> end; <hi>or, between an</hi> indifferency <hi>as to</hi> Law, <hi>and indifferency as to</hi> Order <hi>and</hi> Peace. <hi>Here I ſay, that in things wholly indifferent in both reſpects, that is, in a thing neither commanded nor forbidden by God, nor that has any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent reſpect to the Peace and Order of the Church of God, there can be no ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional account given, why the nature of ſuch indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies ſhould be alter'd by any humane Laws and Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

                  <p>Either the Magiſtrate muſt have regard to good and convenient circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the lawful determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of things in their own nature indifferent; or a thing being ſo indifferent, he may cloath it with what circumſtances he pleaſes. But he may not do ſo, which I prove by theſe inſtances: To dig a pit, is in general, and in its own nature an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different thing; but a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate may not command
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:137166:17"/>me to dig it in an high-way, or in a ſtreet, or any great thorough-fare, becauſe it might occaſion the ruine of many; and ſo is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inconvenient, but unlawful. Again, A Magiſtrate may lawfully command me to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver my fire, and rake it up in a ſafe place; but he may not command me to lay it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſtraw, or near Gunpowder; becauſe this would be to the evident endangering of my houſe, and conſequently unlawful. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to make a lawful determination of an indifferency, ſo as thereby not to encroach on <hi>Chriſtian Liberty;</hi> there muſt be a concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of circumſtances conſtituting a <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial goodneſs,</hi> or neceſſity: without which, if the reſtraint depend meerly and ſolely upon the Law-makers will, it is a direct breach of Liberty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

We may not yield up our liberties; yet if they be taken away from us, we may ſubmit without ſin.</p>
                  <p>Thus have I tranſcribed my thoughts, and ſtated the caſe as clearly as I could in this ravel'd point of <hi>Chriſtian Liberty,</hi> by ſhowing wherein it does conſiſt, how far forth it is
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:137166:23"/>liable to be impoſed upon, and baffled by humane Conſtitutions, and what muſt be done for the aſſerting thereof.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>total Sum</hi> of the whole diſcourſe is this: That though Obedience to Magiſtrates and Chriſtian Liberty are very conſiſtent, yet for Magiſtrates to lay a reſtraint upon Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferencies meerly, <hi>quia placet &amp; libet,</hi> is an abridgment and infringment of Chriſtian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, which we muſt not <hi>willingly</hi> admit of, nor be <hi>acceſſory</hi> to, though we may <hi>ſubmit.</hi> But if they do it <hi>quia expedit,</hi> when there are ſufficient reaſons for it from any <hi>circumſtantial conſideration,</hi> ſo long as thoſe reaſons hold good (of which every one is to be judge, for ſo much as concerns his own practice), this is no breach at all. Our liberty remains ſtill entire to us, notwithſtanding ſuch a determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
                  <p>Now if any one ſhall ſtumble at this, and think it ſtrange that I take off the lawfulneſs of the determination from the <hi>Will</hi> (which perhaps they may call the <hi>Authority</hi>) of the Lawgiver, and lay it upon a <hi>concurrence of circumſtances,</hi> and ſo attribute and aſcribe that to <hi>circumſtances,</hi> which I deny to <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity:</hi> I ſhall offer this (which is very obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) for their further ſatisfaction, <hi>viz.

I ſay, a concurrence of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances may make that which otherwiſe is unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to be lawful, as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by <hi>David</hi>'s eating the <hi>ſhew-bread</hi> when he was an hungred, which otherwiſe had been unlawful; and therefore the <hi>Jews,</hi> when there was no ſuch <hi>providential neceſſity,</hi> choſe rather to dye than to eat <hi>ſwines-fleſh,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Mac. 7.1.</note> (forbidden by God, as the <hi>ſhew-bread</hi> was) though commanded by man. So if <hi>Saul</hi> and his Army had been ready to ſtarve, and could have got no other proviſion but the <hi>Amale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kites</hi> cattel, certainly God's preferring <hi>mercy before ſacrifice,</hi> would have warranted them to have killed and eaten thereof, though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe they were commanded to deſtroy them, and reſerve none. Now if that in thoſe things which otherwiſe are unlawful, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of circumſtances can do that which no humane authority can, <hi>viz.</hi> make them lawful; then much more in Indifferencies may
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:137166:24"/>it do that which no humane authority can, <hi>viz.</hi> lay a reſtraint upon the uſe of them, as is evident by this inſtance.

                  <p n="1">1. For Scripture. Thus much is plainly intimated by Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.36. <hi>Every idle word that men ſhall ſpeak, they ſhall give account thereof in the day of judgement,</hi> i. e. for every unprofitable, unfruitful word, that brings good neither to ſpeaker nor hearer, then they are not indifferent; and if <hi>words,</hi> when cloathed with circumſtances, cannot be indifferent, then neither <hi>Thoughts</hi> nor <hi>Works,</hi> which are as much the iſſue and product of reaſon, as ſpeech.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For Reaſon.

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:137166:30"/>he follows the rules of his Art, and then he makes a good ſtatue, or he departs from thoſe rules, and then he makes a bad one, and does not work like an artiſt; ſo many times it may be to a Chriſtian a matter meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly indifferent to do ſuch a thing at this time or another, in this place or another, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and may be left to his own choice and pleaſure therein; but yet as he is a Chriſtian, he is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to regard ſuch and ſuch circumſtances in all his actions; and therefore whatſoever he does, he doth it either well or ill; for ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he obſerves theſe circumſtances, and then his action is good; or he neglects them, and then 'tis bad.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. For Authority. <hi>Aquinas</hi> determines the queſtion thus: 12ae. q. 18. a. 9. <hi>Quemvis actum humanum in individuo conſideratum, quando ex deliberatâ ratione procedit, bonum eſſe vel malum, neceſſe eſt.</hi> So another great Scholar of our own, <hi>Nulla eſt individua actio humana quae eſt indifferens, ſed propter circumſtantias neceſſario vel bona vel mala, ſi Thomae &amp; omnibus Thomiſtis credimus.</hi> Mort. Ap. part 1. l. 1. c. 47. I ſhall need to add no more, becauſe this laſt teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is pregnant with many others. Yet for all this. I add,</p>
                  <p n="5">(5) And laſtly, An action even <hi>in individuo</hi> may be indifferent in reſpect of any <hi>Precept</hi> or <hi>Prohibition,</hi> though not in reſpect of <hi>good</hi> and <hi>evil.</hi> There may be the neceſſity of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in an action, when it is done, to make
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:137166:31"/>it good (viz. <hi>bonitas intentionis,</hi> or <hi>directionis,</hi> and <hi>bonitas principii</hi>), and yet the action it ſelf <hi>pro hic &amp; nunc,</hi> be no ways neceſſary, but indifferent, and a matter of liberty. This is very well illuſtrated by one, by comparing it with what is uſually ſaid of God's particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar actions,
<note place="margin">Stillingfl. Iren p. 52.</note> 
                     <hi>That God is free in himſelf either to do, or not to do that action (as ſuppoſe, the Creation of the world); but when he does it, he muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily do it with that goodneſs, holineſs, and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which is ſuitable to his nature; ſo may many actions of men be in themſelves indifferent, and yet there muſt be a concomitant neceſſity of good intention and principle to make the action good. But this concomitant neceſſity does not deſtroy the radical indifferency of the action it ſelf; it is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an antecedent neceſſity from the obligation of the Law, which deſtroys indifferency.</hi> Thus much alſo for the nature of this <hi>circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, extrinſecal indifferency.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, This <hi>circumſtantial indifferency</hi> is either <hi>Abſolute,</hi> or <hi>Comparative.

                     <hi>That as the will of God exerting and putting forth his natural power or ſtrength, is in natural things the firſt efficient Cauſe; ſo the will of God exerting his moral power or authority, is in moral things the firſt obliging Rule: And as all things in nature act dependingly upon the will of God, putting forth his natural power as the firſt efficient cauſe; ſo in Morality, all Laws oblige dependingly upon the will of God, putting forth his Moral power as the firſt obliging Rule.</hi> Whence I infer, That where there is no intimation of God's Will, neither expreſs nor implicit, in the nature of the thing, nor in any circumſtance, there can no obligation ariſe. (3) That command which has no Conformity to the rule and end of all Laws (the
<note place="margin">* <hi>Neceſſe eſt legem ſemper ad bonum commune ordinari.</hi> Aqu. 12ae. q. 90 a. 2.</note> publick good) can have
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:137166:33"/>no obligation at all following upon it; for the due matter of a Law is wanting; but ſuch a command has no Conformity, <hi>&amp;c. Ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">(4) That the Command of Authority does not render <hi>ſuch</hi> an indifferent thing neceſſary, may be proved, I think, undeniably, from that paſſage, mentioned <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.1-9. <hi>Mark</hi> 7.1-13. concerning the Diſciples eating with unwaſhen hands; for which they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of by the Scribes and Phariſees (thoſe great <hi>Maſters of Ceremonies</hi>) to Chriſt, as tranſgreſſors of the <hi>Tradition of the Elders:</hi> But Chriſt is ſo far from condemning, that he juſtifies and vindicates them for it; and on the contrary, condemns their Antagoniſts, for ſtanding ſo ſtrictly, and laying ſo much ſtreſs upon ſuch unneceſſary trifles. Here I obſerve, Firſt, That the Rite, or Ceremony in queſtion was in it ſelf <hi>indifferent,</hi> i. e. nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther commanded nor forbidden by any Law of God; and ſo far from being unlawful, that it ſeems rather a matter of civil decency and good manners. Secondly, This was commanded by a lawful Authority; for (1) the Scribes and Phariſees (who here urged it, and ſtickled for it) <hi>ſate in Moſes's ſeat,</hi> (<hi>Mat.</hi> 23.2.) i. e. were the Rulers of the people (or ſome of them at leaſt) who did ſucceed <hi>Moſes</hi> in the ordinary office of Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Ruling the people. And (2) it was a <hi>Tradition of the Elders:</hi> Now the <hi>Elders</hi> were
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:137166:33"/>the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> that is, the Supreme Authority of the Nation; and, a <hi>Tradition of the Elders,</hi> is a Reſolution, Conſtitution, or Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch a caſe made by them, who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are called <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>Domini conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutionum juridicarum.</hi> Thirdly, This conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Authority did not render this indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent practice, or uſage, neceſſary, as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from the whole drift and ſcope of our Saviour Chriſt's diſcourſe here. From all which, the concluſion or inference holds firm and ſtrong, That an indifferent thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by lawful Authority, is not <hi>thereby</hi> made neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>For the further clearing hereof, I ſhall paſs from one end of my thoughts to the other by theſe ſteps, having firſt prepared the way by theſe Diſtinctions.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, I diſtinguiſh between the <hi>Matter</hi> and the <hi>Form</hi> of a Command; or, between the thing commanded, and the <hi>ſtamp</hi> of Authority ſet upon it to make it <hi>currant.</hi> The ground of this diſtinction is plain in reaſon.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I diſtinguiſh between an <hi>Intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecal</hi> and an <hi>Extrinſecal Indifference</hi> (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore).</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I diſtinguiſh between <hi>unlawful</hi> and <hi>inconvenient.</hi> This I ground upon the Apoſtles words, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.12. <hi>All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient.</hi> Where he ſuppoſes, that things may be <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> in ſome reſpect, but <hi>inconvenient</hi> or <hi>inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient</hi>
                     <pb n="58" facs="tcp:137166:34"/>in others. Whence I gather, (1) That <hi>unlawful</hi> and <hi>inconvenient</hi> are not the ſame, no more than <hi>lawful</hi> and <hi>convenient;</hi> for <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariorum eadem eſt ratio.</hi> (2) I further ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>nature of inconvenient,</hi> or <hi>inexpedient,</hi> and how it differs from <hi>unlawful,</hi> viz. That <hi>inconvenient</hi> or <hi>inexpedient is only an irregular circumſtance of ſomething in its own nature law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</hi> He is there ſpeaking of indifferent things, and tells us, That though in their own nature theſe be all lawful to make uſe of, yet they may be ſo circumſtantiated, as to render them <hi>inconvenient,</hi> or <hi>inexpedient.</hi> Which circumſtantial irregularity puts on ſuch a kind of evil, as the good or rule it offends againſt, is of; if it be only againſt ſome <hi>debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum natura,</hi> then 'tis <hi>malum phyſicum,</hi> or <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rale;</hi> as to faſt to the detriment of a mans health, to eat that which agrees not with his conſtitution: If againſt good manners, then 'tis <hi>malum morale,</hi> as to be ſlovenly in eating: either of theſe irregularities render a thing but <hi>inexpedient:</hi> But if it be againſt any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God, then 'tis <hi>malum Theologicum,</hi> or <hi>peccatum,</hi> and ſo falls in with <hi>unlawful.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, I diſtinguiſh between a <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar inconvenience,</hi> which is only ſo to ſome particular perſons, or at ſome particular time; and a <hi>general inconvenience,</hi> which is alike inconvenient to all perſons, at all times, and in all places. This diſtinction has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon experience to warrant its validity.</p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:137166:34"/>
                  <p>Fifthly, I diſtinguiſh between <hi>ſubmiſſion for wrath,</hi> and <hi>for conſcience-ſake,</hi> i. e. meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for fear of the penalty, or elſe for fear of ſin, and to avoid that which he ſhould be guilty of in caſe of diſobedience and non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubmiſſion. This diſtinction the Apoſtle makes to my hand, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13 5.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, I diſtinguiſh between an <hi>arbitrary</hi> and a <hi>neceſſary ſubmiſſion;</hi> where there is <hi>no ſin</hi> in the ſubmiſſion, and yet 'tis <hi>not a duty,</hi> but free and arbitrary; and where there is ſin in the non-ſubmiſſion, and ſubmiſſion is a duty and neceſſary. The ground of this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction will appear afterwards.</p>
                  <p>Now theſe diſtinctions I apply thus.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prop.</hi> 1. It is certain that the <hi>Command of law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful authority,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>That Magiſtrates ought to be obeyed in things good and lawful, does not ariſe from the authority veſted in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but from the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate command of God, that in ſuch things they ought to be obeyed.</hi> Diſcourſe conc. Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turg. p. 55.</note> 
                     <hi>quatenus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,</hi> i. e. <hi>the form of the Command, doth not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily bring an obligation to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience along with it:</hi> The obligation does not ariſe meerly from the <hi>form;</hi> for then every command, or every thing having the ſtamp of Authority upon it, ſhould oblige; which none will ſay. Therefore,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The Matter of the Command muſt have ſome influence into the obligation thereof.</hi> There be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only the <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Form,</hi> if the <hi>Form</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:137166:35"/>cannot do it, then the <hi>Matter</hi> muſt do ſomething towards it. Yet,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Not every Command neither de materiâ li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citâ does oblige,</hi> becauſe due circumſtances alſo muſt be obſerved (as was ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore), whereby it may be prepared and made habitable for the form to dwell in. But,</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>The matter muſt be lawful</hi> (i. e. either ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, or indifferent, at leaſt) <hi>and alſo duly circumſtantiated. He is the Miniſter of God to thee for good,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.4. Therefore if it be not good, at leaſt extrinſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, and in reſpect of circumſtances (which an inconveniency or inexpediency is not) he is not the Miniſter of God therein. Then,</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>That which is both lawful in its own nature, and moreover cloathed with a handſome dreſs of circumſtances, when commanded, becomes neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi> and ſubmiſſion thereto a duty, and muſt be done for conſcience-ſake, and the neglect thereof is a ſin. I lay the <hi>formality</hi> of the obligation, neither upon the <hi>matter</hi> nor <hi>form,</hi> ſingly conſidered, but upon the <hi>union,</hi> or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of both, ſo as that the <hi>matter</hi> muſt have ſome kind of goodneſs, either <hi>intrinſecal</hi> or <hi>circumſtantial,</hi> as the foundation; whence there ariſes <hi>obligatio fundamentalis,</hi> and then the command, ſupervening upon that matter, produces <hi>obligationem formalem;</hi> both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther make the obligation perfect and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat: Either alone is but like a <hi>ſingle knot,</hi>
                     <pb n="61" facs="tcp:137166:35"/>which does not tye hard, but both together make a <hi>double knot,</hi> which holds faſt.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>That which is lawful in its own nature, and generally convenient, and has only ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular inconvenience attending it, does alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come neceſſary when commanded,</hi> becauſe the general reſpect outweighs the particular; and therefore, in general, all are bound to obey for conſcience-ſake; and thoſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſons to whom it is inconvenient, muſt either get a diſpenſation, or undergo the inconvenience for the general good. <hi>E. g.</hi> If the uſe of Fiſh be convenient for a Nation, and thereupon a Law be made to enjoyn the eating thereof at ſuch a time of the year, then obedience is neceſſary; and though this be inconvenient for ſome perſons, whoſe conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions agree not with it, yet they muſt either obey, and ſo indure the inconvenience, or procure a diſpenſation. But,</p>
                  <p n="7">7. <hi>That which is lawful in its own nature, if attended with ſome irregular circumſtances which render it generally inconvenient and inexpedient, though commanded, does not become neceſſary,</hi> nor ſubmiſſion thereto a duty, nor neglect thereof a ſin. The reaſon is, becauſe bare authority without reaſon, lays no obligation upon the conſcience (as was proved before): but here is only bare authority without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; for the reaſon of the command, where the matter of it is indifferent, muſt be fetch't from the expediency and conveniency of its
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:137166:36"/>circumſtances; which not being to be found here in the caſe ſuppoſed, there is no reaſon neither, and ſo obliges not the conſcience: Submiſſion is not a duty; we are not bound to obey for conſcience-ſake.</p>
                  <p>I know ſome are of opinion, that it <hi>may be a duty to obey, where it is a ſin to command.</hi> But againſt that Poſition, I have this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Obligation to obedience, and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to command, are Correlates; ſo that where there is no authority to command, there can be no obligation to obey: (<hi>viz.</hi> by vertue of that Command; for poſſibly an obligation may ariſe upon ſome other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, as we ſhall ſee preſently, in <hi>Propoſ.</hi> 9.) But here is no authority to command; for we ſuppoſe the Magiſtrate ſins in commanding. Now ſure, no man has authority to ſin. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the Magiſtrates authority reaches only to that which is good, as was before ſhewed out of the Apoſtles words, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.4. and elſewhere he tells us, all Eccleſiaſtical au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is for <hi>Edification</hi> only, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.12. Yet,</p>
                  <p n="8">8. <hi>Where the inconvenience attending the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, is only ſuch as keeps within the compaſs of ſome natural or civil evil, and ſinks not down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſin or tranſgreſſion of ſome Law of God, there, though obedience does not become neceſſary and a duty, and I am not bound to obey for conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence-ſake, yet I may ſubmit for wrath, and for fear of ſuch a penalty as will outweigh the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:137166:36"/>I ſhall have by non-ſubmiſſion.</hi> And this by vertue of that Rule, <hi>Ex duobus malis, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimum;</hi> it's better to undergo an <hi>inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> than a <hi>miſchief. E.g.</hi> If I may not hear a Sermon with my hat on, under penalty of 5 <hi>l.</hi> though it be ſomething prejudicial to my health to ſit uncover'd, and ſo a natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience; yet if the advantage I ſhall get by non-ſubmiſſion be not ſo great as the penalty I ſhall incur, I may ſubmit: So, if a Thief will either make me ſwear to conceal him, or take away my life, though it be a Political inconvenience; yet rather than loſe my life, I may ſubmit to it. Nay,</p>
                  <p n="9">9. <hi>If the penalty be ſuch as would hinder me from the performance of a neceſſary duty, then obedience may accidentally, and in that reſpect become</hi>
                     <note n="(a)" place="margin">
                        <hi>An inconvenient mode of worſhip is a ſin in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer, and in the chuſer, and voluntary uſer, that might offer God better, and will not,</hi> Mal. 1.13, 14. <hi>and yet it may be not only lawful, but a duty to him, that by violence is neceſſitated to offer up that or none.</hi> Grand Debate. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to Anſw. ſect. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>neceſſary, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſuch a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial inconvenience.</hi> E. g. If that either I muſt kneel at receiving the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or cannot be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to partake thereof; if I judge kneeling (not <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful</hi> in it ſelf, but) only <hi>inconvenient,</hi> in reſpect of its unſuitableneſs to the nature of the Ordinance, then I am <hi>(accidentally)</hi> bound to kneel, rather than to omit recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving (a neceſſary duty) for that inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:137166:37"/>Again, If I muſt either baptize a child at the Font, or be deprived of the exerciſe of my Miniſtry, though I judge Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Sacrament of Baptiſm at the Font (which always ſtands at the lower end of the Church, where the Congregation cannot ſo well hear) not ſo convenient as at the reading-Pew; yet rather than be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the exerciſe of my Miniſtry for ſuch a circumſtance, I ought to ſubmit to ſuch an inconvenience. So, though I judge ſuch a form inconvenient, yet if I muſt uſe that, or not exerciſe my Miniſtry; the latter being a duty, I ought to ſubmit to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. On this ground, I ſuppoſe, <hi>Calvin</hi> went in uſing wafer-cakes in the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Lords Supper: For, at firſt he refuſed to adminiſter the Communion with unleavened bread and wafer-cakes, and was thereupon compelled to depart out of the City; but afterwards he was received again upon his allowance of that ſame kind of bread. <hi>De quo poſteà reſtitutus, nunquam con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendendum putavit; minimè tamen diſſimulans, quod alioqui magis eſſet probaturus,</hi> ſaith <hi>Beza.</hi> In all theſe caſes. Edification is the end, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and Order the means; now the end is that which principally we muſt be ruled by in theſe things; and therefore where a more convenient means cannot be had, by reaſon of any either natural or moral hinderance, there a leſs convenient becomes neceſſary, ſo
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:137166:37"/>long as the End may be attain'd thereby. Yea further yet.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. <hi>In the caſe put, I may not only do that which I judge to be inconvenient, but ſuffer ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to do that which I judge to be unlawful, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than be deprived of a neceſſary Ordinance. E. g.</hi> If either I muſt have my Child baptized with the ſign of the Croſs, or not baptized at all, I may ſuffer it to be done in that way, though I judge it an unlawful addition; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the manner concerns him that does it, not me (at leaſt, not ſo much) ſo long as there is all the eſſence. He muſt be reſponſible for any irregularity in the manner, not I. Thus <hi>Jacob</hi> took <hi>Laban</hi>'s Oath, though by his Idols. And Chriſt did joyn with the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church in their Adminiſtrations of God's Ordinances, though there were many Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions therein, rather than not partake of the Ordinances at all. But,</p>
                  <p n="11">11. <hi>If the inconvenience be ſuch as would overthrow the main end of the duty, and is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent therewith, then the indifferency is ſo far from becoming neceſſary, that notwithſtanding the command it is unlawful, and I may not obey, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the penalty be. E. g.</hi> If I may not pray or read in the Congregation, but with ſuch a tone and modulation of the voice, as would Pender what is ſo prayed or read unintelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; I muſt rather ſuffer any penalty, than perform the duty in ſuch a manner, becauſe the Congregation cannot be edified thereby,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:137166:38"/>nor underſtandingly joyn with me therein; and ſo I do but take God's name in vain.</p>

                  <p>There's another ſenſe of the word [<hi>offence</hi> and <hi>offend</hi>] uſual in our language, <hi>viz.</hi> for <hi>matter of anger</hi> or <hi>diſpleaſure:</hi> As when one

Though I muſt needs ſay, there are two or three places (were I not biaſs'd by the current of Interpreters, and that I dare not venture to ſwim againſt the ſtream) would otherwiſe ſeem to me very much to encline to this ſenſe. I ſhall lay them before you, and leave them to your conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.23. <hi>Thou art an offence to me.</hi> Methinks it might very fairly and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally be paraphraſed thus: Thou doſt trouble me to ſee how ignorant thou art of the great work of Redemption by my death and ſufferings.

But however, whether theſe places will bear this ſenſe or no, this I am ſure of, that the Apoſtle expreſſes Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal by <hi>Grief,</hi> Rom. 14.15. <hi>If thy brother be

Are you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſted at this Doctrine? Will it not down with you? Doth it not reliſh with you, nor pleaſe your palate? Can you not digeſt it? Doth it ſtick in your ſtomach? Although, I muſt confeſs, it may as fairly be underſtood in that ſenſe before given of ſeveral places, thus: Doth this give you occaſion to think hardly and ſtrangely of any of the myſteries I have delivered unto you, or tempt you to forſake and lay down your profeſſion of my Doctrine? There's one place more to which this notion of the word ſeems not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther impertinent, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.6. (<hi>Mar.</hi> 9.42.) <hi>Whoſoever ſhall offend one of theſe little ones,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Offend,</hi> i. e. by not receiving (for ſo it's op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:137166:42"/>to <hi>receive,</hi> in the former verſe), and ſo grieve, and diſcourage him. But this ſenſe is ſo doubtful and obſcure, that I find learned men do wholly wave and diſown it in the conſideration of Scandal. So Dr. <hi>Hammond. To be angry, grieved, troubled at any action of another, is not [to be offended] in Scripture-ſenſe; nor conſequently does it follow that I have done amiſs in doing that which another man is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry at, unleſs mine action be in it ſelf evil.</hi> Of <hi>Scand.</hi> p. 23. Dr. <hi>Jer. Taylor. He only gives Scandal, who induces his Brother, directly or col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laterally, into ſin, as appears by all the Diſcourſes in Scripture guiding us in this duty.</hi> Life of Chriſt, Part 3. Diſc. 16. ſect. 5. Edit. in 4to. And another. <hi>Scandal or offence is not the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving or diſpleaſing my Brother; for peradventure when I grieve him or diſpleaſe him, I do edifie him. Now Edification and Scandal are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible.</hi> Engl. Pop. Cerem. part 2. c. 8. ſect. 2. So that I dare not <hi>vouch</hi> the uſe of the word <hi>[Scandal]</hi> in the <hi>notion</hi> of <hi>grief</hi> or <hi>diſpleaſure</hi> in any place of Scripture, except in that of <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.15. Where it ſeems rather to be mentioned as an <hi>adjunct</hi> or <hi>companion of Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal,</hi> than the <hi>formalis ratio,</hi> or that wherein properly it does conſiſt. I have been the more large and particular in this, becauſe I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend an exact conſideration of the <hi>propriety</hi> and <hi>uſe</hi> of the word in Scripture will much conduce to the more full and clear handling this point, and be of ſpecial uſe in our fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing diſcourſe.</p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:137166:43"/>
                  <p>And the ſum of all is this; That the word <hi>[Scandal]</hi> or <hi>[Offence]</hi> in Scripture is moſt uſually taken for <hi>occaſion of ſin;</hi> ſometimes for <hi>occaſion of cenſuring</hi> or <hi>judging</hi> the perſon ſcandalizing as looſe and licentious, and one that walks not ſtrictly according to the Rule of the Goſpel; which may be attended with <hi>grief</hi> of heart and trouble of ſpirit for that ſin, which the party offended conceives is committed againſt God.</p>

                  <p>The nature of Scandal in general, may be thus expreſſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A Scandal is a word, or action, or omiſſion of either, manifeſt to another, which occaſions his fall into ſin or ſorrow.</hi> If this <hi>word</hi> or <hi>action,</hi> or <hi>omiſſion,</hi> be a <hi>duty</hi> or any thing neceſſary <hi>pro hic &amp; nunc,</hi> 'tis Scandal only <hi>taken,</hi> and not given; if it be any thing <hi>evil,</hi> 'tis Scandal <hi>given,</hi> whether it be taken or no; that alters not the caſe: but if it be <hi>indifferent,</hi> 'tis only <hi>given,</hi> when it is <hi>taken.</hi> So then, to the buſineſs in hand.</p>
                  <p>

To preach Chriſt crucified, which was to the <hi>Jews</hi> a <hi>ſtumbling-block,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.23. this was <hi>Scandal taken,</hi> but not <hi>given.</hi> To eat <hi>Idolothytes</hi> in private houſes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.13. <hi>If meat make my Brother to offend;</hi> This was <hi>Scandal given,</hi> if it were <hi>taken,</hi> but otherwiſe it was no Scandal at all.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. —or <hi>omiſſion of either</hi>] Men may be ſcandalized at the <hi>omiſſion</hi> of that which they look upon to be a duty, as well as at the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion</hi> of that which they conceive to be a ſin. Hence Chriſt to avoid ſcandal, pays tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.27. <hi>Nevertheleſs leſt we ſhould offend them,</hi> &amp;c. implying, that the <hi>omiſſion</hi> there of might prove ſcandalous. So the <hi>Jews</hi>
                     <pb n="78" facs="tcp:137166:44"/>were offended at <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>omiſſion</hi> of the <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Law,</hi> Act. 21.21, 24.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. All this muſt be <hi>unneceſſary.</hi>] An <hi>unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary ſpeaking, doing,</hi> or <hi>omitting;</hi> or, <hi>ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, doing,</hi> or <hi>omitting</hi> that which is <hi>not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,</hi> or, which is <hi>indifferent.</hi> And this makes the difference between <hi>Scandal given,</hi> and <hi>Scandal taken,</hi> and makes the <hi>ſpeaking, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> or <hi>omitting</hi> to be culpable; for if my <hi>ſpeaking, doing,</hi> or <hi>omitting</hi> be a <hi>duty,</hi> or <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,</hi> then I am not culpable, though ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal follows upon it; but if it be <hi>not neceſſary,</hi> then I am. So that this is the <hi>hinge</hi> upon which this buſineſs of Scandal <hi>turns,</hi> and the <hi>touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone</hi> by which we muſt <hi>try</hi> whether we be cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, or no. And indeed here is the main difficulty; for every one will grant, That that which is <hi>neceſſary,</hi> is <hi>not matter of ſcandal given;</hi> or, I am not culpable though ſcandal fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows: but then they differ in aſſigning the extent of <hi>neceſſaries,</hi> and in defining what is neceſſary, what not. The <hi>ordinary gloſs</hi> on <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.12. reſolves it thus: <hi>Dimittendum eſt propter ſcandalum, quicquid dimitti poteſt, ſalvâ triplici veritate, vitae, doctrinae, &amp; juſtitiae. We muſt forbear in caſe of ſcandal, whatſoever may be forborn, with a ſalvo to the threefold truth, of life, of faith, and of juſtice.</hi> But this reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution may ſeem to labour with the malady of <hi>obſcurum per obſcurius,</hi> and therefore we will diſmiſs it. <hi>Gregory</hi> ſaith, That whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may be forborn without ſin, muſt be

I think we may diſpatch the buſineſs, and ſolve the principal difficulty by a diſtinction or two (formerly made uſe of).</p>
                  <p>There's a twofold Neceſſity. <hi>Intrinſecal,</hi> imprinted upon the nature of things, and ſo belonging to the whole kind, as to hear, pray, <hi>&amp;c. Circumſtantial,</hi> which is not <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi> but <hi>particular,</hi> ariſing only from ſome circumſtance, which makes it neceſſary <hi>pro hic &amp; nunc</hi> in ſuch a particular reſpect; as, to ſtand in a Pulpit, or ſome ſuch high place, when I am Preaching, that I may be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter heard; to be uncovered when I am pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Congregation in token of reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; to come to the Church to partake of the publick Ordinances, becauſe that place
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:137166:45"/>is ordinarily more fit and convenient than another: to eat meat offer'd to Idols, when no other can be had. Thus <hi>abſtaining from blood</hi> and <hi>things ſtrangled,</hi> is called a <hi>neceſſary thing</hi> for the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> Act. 15.28. <hi>viz.</hi> not <hi>intrinſecally</hi> from any general ſtanding Law, but <hi>circumſtantially,</hi> and in that particular caſe, in reſpect of the Scandal the <hi>Jews</hi> did take at eating of them. Now this kind of neceſſity admits of a very great latitude; ſo that whatſoever hath but any tolerable, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable degree of convenience, whether moral, natural, or civil, comes within the compaſs of this neceſſity. But then we muſt take another diſtinction along with us.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>circumſtantial neceſſity</hi> is either <hi>Abſolute</hi> or <hi>Comparative. Abſolute,</hi> when a neceſſary end cannot be attain'd by other means. So, it's abſolutely neceſſary that but one at once ſhould be ſpeaking in the ſame Congregation,
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.28-33.</note> becauſe the contrary would breed diſorder and confuſion, deſtructive of edification; and likewiſe that he that ſpeaks ſhould ſpeak in a known tongue. <hi>Comparative,</hi> when ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther means may ſerve as well, and be as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for attaining the end, or at leaſt the end may be attain'd thereby in ſome tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble manner, though it may be not ſo readily and conveniently. Thus a Cloak may be as fitting and decent to Preach in as a Gown; a Divinity-School, or ſome ſuch like place, as convenient as a Church; a high Pew, as a
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:137166:45"/>Pulpit. Now to apply theſe diſtinctions to our preſent purpoſe, I lay down theſe Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That which is neceſſary either intrinſecally or circumſtantially with an abſolute neceſſity, is not matter of ſcandal given;</hi> i. e. if ſcandal do follow upon the doing of it, he is not cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable that does it. In caſe one of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian <hi>Corinthians</hi> could have gotten no other meat, but ſuch as had been offer'd to Idols, and muſt either have eaten that or ſtarved; the eating of this meat being abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in this caſe for the preſervation of his life, and there being no other means in his power for the attaining this neceſſary end, that would have excuſed him, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred him innocent and blameleſs, though Scandal had followed upon it: but in caſe other meat might conveniently have been gotten, and he might have eaten that, then the eating of this particular meat in caſe of Scandal ought to have been forborn. So Chriſt's Doctrine concerning the vain Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the Elders being neceſſary to be delivered, and that the people ſhould be acquainted therewith, excuſed him from blame,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.10</note> though the Phariſees were offended thereat, and makes him regardleſs of their ſcandal: and therefore he ſaith concerning it, <hi>Let them alone, they be blind leaders of the blind,</hi> v. 14. So, Churches being ſo neceſſary for the decent and orderly meeting of the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:137166:46"/>Congregation, and fitted for the ſeveral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, and in few places there being any other buildings that have any tolerable degree of convenience; and becauſe if theſe individual Churches ſhould be pulled down, there would not be others built in their rooms; therefore (though ſome have been ſcandalized at the uſe of them in regard they have formerly been abuſed with Idolatry) it is not matter of ſcandal given, nor does make us culpable by uſing them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>That which has no degree of neceſſity, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in its own nature, nor by reaſon of any cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, or if it have, it is but a comparative neceſſity, which may be compaſſed and attained by other means, muſt be forborn in caſe of ſcandal.</hi> This is ſuch a legible truth, and ſo palpably evident, that Papiſts themſelves ſubſcribe to it; for both
<note place="margin">* <hi>Comment. in</hi> 22 <hi>a. q.</hi> 43. <hi>a.</hi> 7.</note> 
                     <hi>Cajetan</hi> and <hi>Domin. Bannes</hi> ſay, that we ſhould abſtain even <hi>à ſpiritualihus non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſariis,</hi> when ſcandal ariſes out of them: and <hi>Maldonat</hi> in <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.27. tells us that Chriſt ſhunned a Scandal, which would have been meerly paſſive; the reaſon whereof is rendred by <hi>Paraeus (in locum). Debebant enim exactores non ignorare Chriſti immunitatem &amp; dignitatem; quia tamen ignari ejus erant, ne videretur ſcandalum dediſſe, cedere potius ſuâ libertate voluit. Ideò non dicit tantum [ne ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalizentur] ſed [ne ſcandalizemus eos]</hi> i. e. <hi>ne ſcandali materiam iis demus; docens ſcandala ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venda eſſe, etiam cum ceſſione noſtri juris in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:137166:46"/>bus mediis.</hi> Hence, wearing a Surplice being ſcandalous, and officiating in ſome other garment, being as decent, and every way tending as much to the gravity and ſolemnity of the Adminiſtration, therefore it ought to be forborn, where there is no more neceſſity for the uſing, than for the forbearing. So Chriſt's inſiſting upon his priviledge, and making up of his liberty and freedom in caſe of paying tribute, not being neceſſary, he waves it, when he ſaw ſcandal might have followed upon it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.25-27.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Though the end cannot be altogether ſo well and conveniently attain'd; yet if it may be at all obtain'd without any conſiderable degree of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience, in caſe the other (though more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient) means, prove ſcandalous, it renders culpable by the uſe of it:</hi> Or more plainly thus. <hi>We are bound to part with ſome conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies (eſpecially in civil matters) for the avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing offence.</hi> This I gather both from <hi>Paul</hi>'s Reſolution, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. <hi>ult.</hi> If <hi>meat make my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to offend,</hi> &amp;c. Though poſſibly it might be inconvenient for him, and prejudicial to his health totally to forbear the uſe of fleſh, yet he reſolves upon a total abſtinence to his dying day, rather than do that which ſhould be offenſive to his brother. I know indeed <hi>Calvin</hi> looks upon his ſpeech as hyperboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and makes the plain meaning to be only this, <hi>Se nunquam potius uſurum ſuâ libertate, quàm ut ſit infirmis offendiculo;</hi> and others li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:137166:47"/>it to the ſubject-matter ſpoken of, <hi>viz.</hi> fleſh offer'd to Idols (which ſenſe I confeſs is not improbable), yet however the general terms and expreſſions he uſes, do countenance that Poſition for which I produced this Text. And ſo I find <hi>Juſtinian</hi> expreſly interpreting it, <hi>Non de Idolothytis tantùm loquitur Apoſtolus, ſed etiam de quovis ciborum genere, quamvis car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes potiſſimùm nominet, quod hactenus de Idolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thytis locutus ſit-in ſpecie genus ipſum intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git, quomodo apertiſſimè explicant Ieronymiani Commentarii.</hi> And ſo <hi>Paraeus. Quaeſtio tantùm erat de carnibus immolatis, eam verò extendit ad carnes in univerſum, quarum uſus abſque con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſiâ eſt licitus.</hi> Beſides, it's agreeable to his <hi>Theſis,</hi> which he lays down in as gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral terms, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.21. <hi>It is good neither to eat fleſh, nor drink wine, nor any thing whereby thy brother ſtumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak.</hi> This Poſition may be alſo further confirmed by the inſtance concerning the Brazen Serpent. The Brazen Serpent was preſerved for a Memorial of that miraculous deliverance vouchſafed to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the Wilderneſs from the ſtinging of the fiery Serpents. This end, though it might be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd by other means, <hi>viz.</hi> Records, and Scripture, and Information, or Tradition, yet not ſo clearly and fully (for <hi>ſegnius irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant,</hi> &amp;c.) yet becauſe it might ſufficiently be attain'd otherwiſe, when the continuance of it proved ſcandalous, and it became an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:137166:47"/>and occaſion of Idolatry; <hi>Hezekiah</hi> brake it in pieces, calling it <hi>Nehuſhtan,</hi> a piece of Braſs: which fact of his is regiſtred by the Holy Ghoſt among his good deeds, and rank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with oth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But now for the <hi>degrees</hi> of <hi>convenience</hi> or <hi>inconvenience,</hi> which render <hi>culpable</hi> or <hi>excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable,</hi> Chriſtian Prudence muſt determine them by a due weighing of circumſtances.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. As for that neceſſity which ariſes from the Command of the Magiſtrate, it has been ſpoken to already in the diſcourſe about In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency; where we ſhewed, that ſo far forth as an indifferent thing is made convenient by circumſtances, when it is enjoyned, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes neceſſary: and therefore without any more ado, we now paſs on in the Deſcription of Scandal.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. —<hi>manifeſt unto others.</hi>] That which is done <hi>ſecretly</hi> without the privity of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or which is only <hi>inward</hi> in the heart and ſoul, though it may be an <hi>offence</hi> againſt God, and <hi>ſinful,</hi> yet is not <hi>offenſive</hi> to men, and <hi>ſcandalous.</hi> Hence <hi>Tertullian</hi> defines <hi>ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum</hi> by <hi>exemplum,</hi> ſomething that is exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. —<hi>whereby I know.</hi>] In this kind of Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal, if it come not to my knowledge, I am not culpable: therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>v.</hi> 28. <hi>If any man ſay unto thee,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>q. d.</hi> If he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints thee with his ſcruple, then thou art
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:137166:48"/>bound to forbear, otherwiſe not. Thus much alſo is implied, when he calls ſcandalizing, a deſpiſing or ſetting at nought a weak Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.3, 10. Now I muſt firſt take notice of his ſcruple, before I can be ſaid to neglect, contemn or grieve him by uſing my liberty notwithſtanding his ſcruple. The reaſon hereof is, becauſe in this caſe, Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal conſequent is but <hi>effectus per accidens:</hi> Now however actions done by ignorance of God's Law are ſins, yet contingent events not foreſeen by us, cannot make thoſe actions of ours, which otherwiſe are lawful, to become ſinful, though the event be harmful, as Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> obſerves, <hi>p.</hi> 240. As it is in ſlay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by meer chance, mentioned <hi>Deut.</hi> 19.5. ſuch a chance is a grievous <hi>misfortune,</hi> and in that reſpect to be <hi>lamented,</hi> but not a <hi>ſin,</hi> nor to be <hi>repented;</hi> ſo ſuch caſual ſcandal is to be <hi>bewailed</hi> as a <hi>miſhap,</hi> not <hi>mourned</hi> for as a <hi>ſin.</hi>

                     <hi>to pleaſe peeviſh or froward people, betray our liberty which Chriſt has given us.</hi> But notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all this, upon due examination it will be found, that it's all one who they be that are ſcandalized, and that the qualification of the perſon has no influence at all into the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſo as to make <hi>Pro</hi> or <hi>Con,</hi> to alter it one way or other; but that we muſt look alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether at the matter of the ſcandal, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all at the perſon ſcandalized. We muſt not conſider what moves them, whether ignorance or malice, but what occaſions it in our ſelves: for if it be a neceſſary duty, we muſt not forbear for the weak; if unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, we muſt forbear even for the wicked. This is moſt evident by the Apoſtle's enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in the Text: he makes no diſtinction, but includes all in the prohibition; both <hi>Jews, Gentiles,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> and his <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice</hi> was anſwerable to his <hi>Precept,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.19-22. &amp; <hi>c.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 33. Although it's true, Becauſe weak perſons are moſt apt to be ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized, therefore we muſt be the moſt tender
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:137166:49"/>and careful of them (and therefore the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of our Saviour Chriſt is eſpecially levell'd againſt offending <hi>them,</hi> Luke 17.2. <hi>It were better for him that a Mill-ſtone were hanged about his neck, and that he were caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Sea, than that he ſhould offend one of theſe little ones).</hi> Yet we muſt as well avoid what ſcandalizes the wicked, as the weak; as we muſt no more defraud a rich man than a poor one; nor wound a ſtrong man, than a weak one, or a child; though we may <hi>more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully</hi> avoid one than the other, becauſe they are leſs able to help and relieve themſelves.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. —<hi>doth take</hi>] not <hi>may,</hi> but <hi>doth.</hi> This is one difference between things that are <hi>ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous per ſe,</hi> and in their own natures, <hi>viz.</hi> which either are <hi>abſolutely unlawful,</hi> or at leaſt have a <hi>real appearance of evil,</hi> and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal in theſe indifferencies, that in the former it's enough <hi>quòd de ſui ratione habent quòd ſint inductiva ad peccandum,</hi>

The <hi>poſſibility</hi> of Scandal ſubſequent does ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate their evil and ſinfulneſs, though ſcandal does not <hi>actually</hi> follow; as we ſee in that of Chriſt to <hi>Peter, Mat.</hi> 16.23. <hi>Thou art an offence to me.</hi> He does not ſay [<hi>I am of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with thee</hi>], but <hi>[Thou art an offence].</hi> He checks him for laying a ſtumbling-block in his way; though he could not, was not capable of being offended and ſtumbling at it, yet this did not excuſe him.

                  <p>Now the particular ſin, which Scandal in things indifferent does occaſion, is ordinarily one of theſe two, with their concomitants and conſequents, <hi>viz.</hi> Either,</p>

                     <note place="margin">Lam. 3.51.</note> But if he that is ſcandalized either think it unlawful, or be not ſatisfied of its lawfulneſs, and yet takes example by the other, he falls into ſin. This the Apoſtle calls, being <hi>made weak</hi> (Rom. 14.21.) <hi>i. e.</hi> apt to fall, brought into danger of ſin. This was the caſe <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. It was, before the plenary promulgation of the Goſpel, and deſtruction of the Temple, lawful to obſerve <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Feſtivals and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of meats, and yet <hi>not neceſſary,</hi> but <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different,</hi> (v. 14. <hi>I know and am perſwaded that nothing is unclean of it ſelf</hi>), becauſe Chriſt was come in the fleſh: yet many of the New-Convert-Chriſtians were not ſo fully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with, and ſatisfied about their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in theſe things, but did ſtill <hi>eſteem one day above another</hi> (v. 5.) and ſome meats <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean,</hi> (v. 14.) and conſequently did condemn, or at leaſt ſcruple the non-obſervation of thoſe days, and the eating of thoſe meats: Now ſuch by ſeeing others which were <hi>higher Scholars</hi> perhaps in Chriſt's <hi>School</hi> than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to neglect thoſe days, and that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of meats, were apt to be drawn to act againſt their own conſciences and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which was a great ſin; for <hi>every man ſhould be fully perſwaded in his own mind,</hi> (v. 5.) <hi>but to him that eſteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean,</hi> (v. 14.) and therefore <hi>ſuch an one is damned, or condemned by his own
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:137166:51"/>conſcience, if he eat,</hi> (v. 23.) which was ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalizing, and a heinous ſin in thoſe that did occaſion it.

                  <p n="2">(2) The other ſin which the uſe of Liberty in things indifferent does occaſion, is <hi>Cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſuch a word, action or omiſſion, as unlawful, and the perſon as licentious,</hi> which becauſe there is no ground for in the nature of the thing, (it being, as I ſaid, indifferent) it is the ſin of <hi>raſh judging;</hi> condemned by Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.1. That this is one way whereby the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſcandalized may fall, is evident by the Apoſtle's words, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.29. <hi>Why is my li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty judged of another man's conſcience?</hi> q. d.

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:137166:51"/>
                     <hi>Let not your good be evil ſpoken of.</hi> Thus we uſe to ſay, There is a ſcandal lies upon ſuch a man, for ſuch a thing, <hi>i. e.</hi> he is evil ſpoken of for it; he is cenſured and condemned for it, as a looſe and ungodly perſon; or at leaſt, as one that does amiſs in that particular. The caſe is the ſame if <hi>Religion be evil ſpoken of,</hi> or ſcandalized by reaſon of any unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary word, action, or omiſſion of ours, then we are guilty of ſcandalizing or, of the ſin of ſcandal.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Laſtly, — <hi>or to ſorrow, or be grieved at the ſuppoſed ſin of another.]</hi> There is one place, as I ſaid before, and but one, that clearly brings this within the compaſs of Scandal, <hi>viz.</hi> Rom. 14.15. <hi>But if thy Brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkeſt thou not charitably; Grieved,</hi> viz becauſe he conceives that thereby thou ſinneſt againſt God: which kind of grief and trouble is frequently found in godly perſons upon ſuch occaſions. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.53. <hi>Horror hath taken hold upon me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the wicked that forſake thy law.</hi> v. 136. <hi>Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, becauſe they keep not thy law.</hi> v. 158. <hi>I beheld the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors, and was grieved.</hi> Pſal. 139.21. — <hi>Am not I grieved with them that riſe up againſt thee?</hi> Now this renders the perſon culpable who doth ſo grieve or ſcandalize another, and therefore muſt be avoided. For, as we muſt not grieve the Spirit of God in our own hearts. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.30. ſo neither in the hearts
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:137166:52"/>of any of his people, our brethren and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-members of the ſame myſtical body with our ſelves. God does not willingly do ſo him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.33. <hi>For he doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men;</hi> nor would he have us to do ſo. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13.22. <hi>Becauſe with lies ye have made the heart of the righteous ſad,</hi> &amp;c. And this is the only kind of trouble, offence or diſpleaſure that is conſiderable in the point of Scandal, ſo as to render culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>viz. that which is cauſed with reſpect to God and his glory;</hi> as for that which ariſes upon any other account, as, from any perſonal concernment, becauſe my command is diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed, my opinion contradicted, my will not taken for a law, or the like, it is not at all conſiderable in the point of Scandal, and will not come within the verge of the Scripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notion thereof, for ſcandalizing is deſtroying; but ſuch a diſpleaſing may tend to Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and therefore is not ſcandalizing.</p>
                  <p>Thus we have at length run through the Explication of every branch and particular in the definition of Scandal; from whence we may obſerve, that there are theſe three things conſiderable (though differently) in it.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1) In reſpect of the <hi>perſon offended,</hi> there is an <hi>evil example</hi> in that which he conceives to be unlawful and ſinful, which naturally prompts him to the like.</p>

                  <p n="2">(2) In reſpect of the <hi>perſon ſcandali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing,</hi> he lies under <hi>blame and conſure</hi> for doing that which the other conceives un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3) If the perſon ſcandalized be <hi>Godly,</hi> and one who is tender of God's Honour, then he is grieved for the wrong he conceives is done to God, and the offence againſt him, and the reproach that redounds to Religion by that which he looks upon as ſinful. Each of which is proportionably culpable (and therefore more or loſs carefully to be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) according to the rank I have ſet them in. The firſt, moſt; the ſecond, next; the laſt, leaſt.

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Scandal by doing things, is more ordinary, than by forbearing them.</hi> Where we meet with one inſtance in Scripture or Experience of the latter, we may obſerve ſeveral of the former ſort. For, <hi>Actions</hi> are more obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable and apparent, than <hi>Omiſſions.</hi> As, in point of Law, a <hi>Negative</hi> cannot be proved; ſo here, Omiſſions cannot be ſo readily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned and diſcovered; and therefore Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in ſuch caſes are not ſo influential and attractive, as in caſe of poſitive practice. Beſides, there may be ſo many reaſons for the forbearing of an action, that ſcarce any one who has but ſo much diſcretion as will ſerve him for his every-days-wearing, will think much at it: whereas, poſitive practice, or
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:137166:54"/>actions, that they may be good, muſt be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with ſuch a numerous train of regular circumſtances <hi>(bonum eſt ex integris cauſis)</hi> that it's a hard matter ſo to rank and diſpoſe and govern them, but ſome or other will be picking holes in their coats, and finding faults, and taking occaſion to cenſure them, or us for them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>In things indifferent that may be ſcandalous at one time, or in one place, which is not ſo at or in another:</hi> for ſince this kind of ſcandal does not ariſe neceſſarily, or naturally from the action, but only from the apprehenſion of the obſerver, and ſo <hi>recipitur ad modum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipientis,</hi> therefore one may be ſcandalized, and not another; or the ſame perſon at one time, and not at another. Now becauſe all Scandal ariſes from ſome appearance of evil, either real or imaginary, therefore I diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of a twofold appearance of evil. <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,</hi> which is an occaſion of ſin, as lying in the ſame bed with another man's wife; or elſe a ſign of ſin, as keeping ill company: and <hi>Cuſtomary,</hi> when a thing is commonly abuſed to evil, and is uſually a ſign of evil; as going to Play-houſes is commonly abuſed to evil, and uſed by none almoſt but looſe, debauch't perſons. Now what has an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of evil only by reaſon of Cuſtom, and being uſed only by thoſe that are evil, if in proceſs of time, the cuſtom alters, and it comes to be uſed promiſcuouſly by all ſorts,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:137166:55"/>both good and bad, then the appearance of evil is removed, and it ceaſes to be ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. <hi>E. g.</hi> Taking Tobacco, at the firſt uſe of it amongſt us, was ſcandalous, becauſe practiſed by few, but ſuch as were of the more ranting ſtrain: but afterwards, when it came to be more generally made uſe of, then Cuſtom took away the Scandal of it. The caſe is the ſame in point of Place, as well as Time. That which in ſome places carries a ſhew of evil, as wearing a hood and tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet in a Country Church, elſewhere perhaps is not ſuſpected thereof; as wearing the ſame habiliments in the Univerſity. So <hi>Timothy</hi>'s Circumciſion was ſcandalous among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> not among the <hi>Jews;</hi> and on the contrary, Uncircumciſion was ſcandalous among the <hi>Jews,</hi> not among the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Hence that advice of <hi>

                  <p>And here I conceive, regard is to be had eſpecially to thoſe upon that Place, which is the ſcene of the action, and not ſo much too thoſe reports which are raiſed concerning it: therefore <hi>Paul,</hi> when he was among the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> would not have them circumciſed, though the report thereof ſcandalized the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:137166:55"/>
                     <hi>Jews</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Act. 21.21. And ſo you ſhall find, that the Apoſtles always had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the places where they were preſent, ſo as to <hi>do,</hi> or <hi>not to do,</hi> as the exigence of that place required.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>An action from whence ſcandal follows, may at firſt be innocent and blameleſs, and yet afterwards become culpable and guilty,</hi> viz. if it be continued after the ſcandal is known to follow from it. Thus the Preſervation of <hi>Gideon</hi>'s Ephod, and the Brazen Serpent, was neither evil, nor had any appearance of evil, (they being Monuments of God's mercies) ſo that when the people were firſt ſcandalized by them, the ſcandal was meerly paſſive; but the keeping and retaining of them, after it was known that ſcandal roſe out of them, was culpable (not being neceſſary) and made the ſcandal to become active alſo.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Whatſoever muſt be forborn for the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal of the weak, muſt alſo be forborn for the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal of the wicked and malicious.</hi> All readily acknowledge that the weak are not to be ſcandalized; all the doubt is concerning the malicious, or the <hi>ſcandalum Phariſaeorum,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that be culpable, and to be avoided.

                  <p n="1">(1) The Apoſtles prohibition in the Text is general, <hi>Give none offence;</hi> and the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars he enumerates include all perſons in the world, <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> or <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> Now both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> were oft-times
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:137166:56"/>very malicious againſt the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as we find by many paſſages in the <hi>Hiſtory of the Acts;</hi> and yet even they muſt not be ſcandalized.</p>

And in this caſe a man is bound, ſay they, to avoid the greateſt Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal. Thus the Conformiſts generally; and therefore when they are urged with the Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal of the Ceremonies, they reply, That a greater Scandal is given by neglect of them, <hi>viz.</hi> A ſcandal to the Magiſtrate, and to the dutiful and obedient Sons of the Church.

                  <p>Thus far I think we may accommodate the buſineſs between them, That there may ſome kind of ſcandal follow on both hands. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts themſelves cannot deny, Scandal ariſing from Conformity; and we muſt yield. That perſons many times pretend Scandal by Non-conformity; but then we deny that theſe Scandals are of the ſame kind. We deny that the ſame kind of Scandal follows on both hands, both by doing and forbearing. The Scandal ariſing from Conformity is drawing others into ſin, <hi>viz.</hi> to do that which they are not ſatisfied about the lawfulneſs of, but do doubt that it is unlawful. But the Scandal ariſing from Non-conformity is only, either being diſpleaſed with thoſe perſons that will not comply with their judgements, and do as they do; or at moſt a cenſuring them to be contentious, factious, peeviſh, refractory per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; and therefore the ſcandal ariſing from Conformity is far greater, and of a more hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous and malignant nature, than that which ariſes from Non-conformity, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more carefully to be avoided. But then I add further, by way of Reply to the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cavil. There are weightier and ſtronger reaſons for Non-conformity, than for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity; for there is no reaſon for Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity (at leaſt which they will ſtick to) but Authority; Now that is but <hi>argumentum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>artificiale,</hi> and barely of it ſelf without a good foundation, no reaſon at all. It is but
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:137166:58"/>like a cifer without a figure: Indeed where a figure goes before, a cifer adds much to it, but of it ſelf it is nothing: So where Reaſon goes before, Authority ſtrengthens the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and ties the knot hard; but without Reaſon, 'tis but a cifer. Reaſon <hi>edged</hi> with Authority, and Authority <hi>back't</hi> with Reaſon do mutually ſtrengthen each other; but Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority alone ſignifies little. But now there are many and weighty arguments for Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformity; as may be ſeen fully in all their Writings; which though we ſhould grant to come ſhort of that cogency and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrativeneſs which ſome urge, yet certainly they carry ſuch probability with them, as far out-ſtrips the beſt arguments for Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. And therefore though they ſhould not prove an abſolute unlawfulneſs in the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, yet in this point of Scandal (where reaſons on both ſides are to be weighed) the ſcale againſt Conformity will be far the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier. So that we may ſtill keep our ground, and ſafely aſſert, That Scandal in its proper and primary notion, for inducing into ſin, can only ariſe one way (which is uſually by doing); and in this ſenſe, I ſuppoſe, that paſſage of <hi>Ames</hi> before quoted, is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood. (And therefore Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi>'s ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, <hi>p.</hi> 266, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of his Treatiſe of Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal are levell'd at a wrong mark).</p>

                  <p>To the inſtances alledged by way of proof for a double Scandal, I anſwer to the former:</p>
                  <p>That it was lawful for <hi>Paul</hi> to circumciſe <hi>Timothy;</hi> becauſe his Mother was a Jeweſs (<hi>Act.</hi> 16.1.) to whom the rites of <hi>Moſes</hi> were permitted for a while, <hi>viz.</hi> till the deſtruction of the Temple; and therefore, it being law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to be done, rather than ſcandalize the <hi>Jews,</hi> among whom he was now to exerciſe his Miniſtry, in that caſe it became neceſſary to be done: But <hi>Titus</hi> being a <hi>Greek</hi> (<hi>Gal.</hi> 2.3.) it was not lawful for him to be circumciſed, nor for any of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to obſerve any of the Poſitive (which I oppoſe to Negative) parts of the Ceremonial Law, as Ceremonial; and therefore though the <hi>Jews</hi> watched what he'd do, yet he abſolutely refuſes to circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe him; not for fear of ſcandalizing the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> but becauſe it was not lawful to bring the <hi>Gentiles</hi> under the bondage of the Ceremonial Law (which they would have been thereby, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.2, 3.) as <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf gives the reaſon, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.4.</p>
                  <p>To the other I anſwer, That his eating with the <hi>Gentiles</hi> was a thing neceſſary, and that for the avoiding of two great Scandals; one of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who otherwiſe would have been tempted to <hi>Judaize;</hi> the other of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who otherwiſe would have been confirmed in <hi>Judaiſm.</hi>

If the uſe of indifferent things be for Edification, then we muſt uſe them, as <hi>Paul</hi> did Circumciſion, to <hi>Timothy,</hi> Act. 16.3. for he being to be his companion in his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry among the <hi>Jews,</hi> if he had not been
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:137166:60"/>circumciſed, they would have rejected his ſervice, and never have given him the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

But the caſe is far otherwiſe with us now-a-days: There are no ſuch Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies urged on the one hand, or ſcrupled on the other, which have any ſuch <hi>Divine ſtamp</hi> upon them: There is no ſuch rational ground can be pleaded for a ſubmiſſion to theſe things: They are generally ſuch as have no foundation, but in the ſuperſtitious or er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous fancies of men; and therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with them would rather feed the ill humour, than any way tend to correct, or evacuate it; and ſo would hinder their Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and conſequently ought not to be yielded to.</p>

But ſuppoſe their commands ſhould excuſe ſome (which I cannot grant in the leaſt) in the uſe of thoſe Indifferencies whereat others are offended; yet what plea can they have for themſelves before God, for the commanding ſuch things?

                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. THE impoſed uſe of <hi>Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferencies</hi> has been (like the <hi>Canaanites</hi> to the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites) pricks</hi> in the eyes, and <hi>thorns</hi> (or goads) in the ſides of, <hi>i. e.</hi> matter of much miſchief and vexation to, the Church of God almoſt in all ages; Eſpecially, in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, when it drew towards the dregs, much of this ſediment appeared. How far the <hi>Papal, Anti-Chriſtian</hi> Church is over-run with this ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, is notorious: And it's one great evil which our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church now labours and groans under at this day. 'Tis this, which has been the apple of contention, and bone of diviſion; the ſtone of ſtumbling, and rock of offence among us, ever ſince the beginning of the Reformation, in the time of our <hi>Joſiah,</hi>
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:137166:71"/>King <hi>Edward</hi> the 6th. And after many years freedom from this itch, it brake out again ſome years ſince, to our great diſturbance, and ſcratching of one another.</p>
                  <p>Now for the better fixing our judgements concerning either our Liberty or Reſtraint in ſuch caſes, I ſhall enter upon a ſtrict exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, and narrow conſideration of this portion of Scripture, which furniſhes us with one of the moſt pregnant, and pertinent inſtances, or Hiſtorical paſſages to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, in the whole New Teſtament; which I ſhall examine from top to toe, that thereby we may diſcover how far forth it will help us, either one way or other, <hi>i. e.</hi> either for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, or Non-conformity, in ſuch like caſes.</p>

The whole paſſage contains a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe between Chriſt, and the Scribes and Phariſees, concerning the obſervation of the Traditions of the Elders, occaſion'd by the Diſciples neglect thereof; for which the Scribes and Phariſees implead them to their Maſter, and quarrel him about it: In which he vindicates 'em at large, and blows up the very foundation of their complaint, by ſhowing the invalidity, yea impiety, of theſe Traditions. This is the general pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the whole.

They were both of them, as has been ſaid, the great Preachers and Profeſſors of the Law; and here, as frequently elſewhere, they joyn together to oppoſe and oppreſs Chriſt and his Diſciples, and go hand in hand; that what they cannot effect by ſingle ſtrength, they may obtain by their united forces. <hi>Scribes</hi> was a title of Function, and <hi>Phariſee</hi> of Devotion:

                  <p n="1">(1) This ſenſe is very frequent both in the Old and New Teſtament. I ſhall mention but a few places of the chief; as <hi>Deut.</hi> 22.15.—<hi>the Elders of City in the gate</hi> (the place of Judicature). And they are ſometimes called, <hi>Elders of the people,</hi> i. e. ſuch who had authority over the people; as <hi>Elders of a City,</hi> are they that are in power in that City. Thus <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.3. <hi>Then aſſembled together the chief Prieſts, and Scribes, and Elders of the people.</hi> So <hi>c.</hi> 27.1. <hi>When the morning was come, all the chief Prieſts, and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the people took counſel.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Hence they are commonly joyned with <hi>[Rulers];</hi> as 2 <hi>King.</hi> 10.1. <hi>Jehu wrote let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters—to the Rulers of Jezreel, and to the Elders.</hi> Act. 4.8. <hi>Ye Rulers and Elders of Iſrael;</hi> and they are very frequently joyn'd with <hi>[chief Prieſts, and Scribes and Phariſees;]</hi> and then the diſtinction that was between them, I conceive may be ſtated thus; As they were diſtinguiſht from the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> they ſeem to be Lay-men (as we call 'em), and as diſtinguiſht from <hi>Scribes,</hi> they were ſuch as were not brought up wholly in the ſtudy of the Law, or at leaſt did not make that their Profeſſion; but were ſome of the Nobility and Gentry, admitted to be Members of the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> as is moſt evident from theſe places following, <hi>Acts</hi> 22.5. <hi>The High Prieſt doth bear me wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, with all the eſtate of the Elders; from whom alſo I received letters unto the brethren,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:137166:75"/>and went to Damaſcus, to bring them which were there, bound unto Jeruſalem, for to be puniſht:</hi> and <hi>c.</hi> 24.1. <hi>Ananias the High Prieſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended with the Elders, who informed the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour againſt Paul.</hi> Matth. 26.59. <hi>Now the chief Prieſts and Elders, and all the Council, ſought falſe witneſs againſt Jeſus,</hi> &amp;c. Mark 15.1. <hi>The chief Prieſts held a conſultation with the Elders and Scribes, and the whole Council.</hi> So that nothing is more clear, than that they were Members of the Council, and perſons in, and of, Authority.</p>
                  <p>I have been the more full in this point, becauſe <hi>Grotius in loc.</hi> thinks that theſe El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders here mentioned, though they were learned and wiſe men, and ſo poſſibly might be Members of the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; yet that the mention made of 'em here, does not relate to any ſuch capacity they were in; but only, as celebrated Teachers, who were not only famous in their Generations, but were had in great veneration and eſteem in after-times, and their judgements and dogmes were of great authority. And ſo <hi>Beza</hi> takes 'em too, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the ancient Doctors, and not for perſons in authority. But even <hi>Grotius</hi> himſelf elſewhere (<hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>Acts</hi> 4.5.) gives this account of 'em, <hi>Seniores, idem quod Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natores, &amp; conſules <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbium.

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:137166:75"/>of Cities:</hi> And the places foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned do moſt evidently and undeniably evince, that they were perſons in authority, and members of the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> (as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) or great Council of the Nation: And therefore</p>

                  <p>And particularly, It was the peculiar priviledge of thoſe Doctors who were Members of the great Council to frame ſuch Decrees, Conſtitutions or Traditions. This I gather from that paſſage of the <hi>Targum</hi> on <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.12. where it is ſaid, <gap reason="foreign">

Thus the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> received from God, and delivered to the Church the Doctrine of the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23. and of Chriſt's Death and Reſurrection, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.3. yea, the whole Doctrine of the Goſpel in general is a Tradition, delivered or conveyed to us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.17. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Jude</hi> 3.

                  <p>The former of theſe ſorts, <hi>viz.

I'le give you a taſte, and but a taſte of 'em. It was a Tradition, that on a Feſtival-day it was not lawful to blow the fire with a pair of bellows, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that had ſome reſemblance of a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanick work; but they might blow it through a hollow Cane. Again, On a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtival-day it was not lawful to lay wood on the fire in an artificial manner, ſo as
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:137166:78"/>to reſemble a building. But enough of theſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 11. Secondly, What was the ground they went upon, or the occaſion of their firſt broaching theſe Traditions? In general, it was, as they expreſs it, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> To make a hedg to the Law, that men ſhould not break in upon it to tranſgreſs it: and this was a ſpecious colour for all their Traditions; for they pretending to make Conſtitutions to fence the Law from viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to raiſe the obſervance of it the higher, they multiplied inventions and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of their own brains, and ſet 'em up for Laws, and ſo made the Law indeed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worth. I ſhall give you an inſtance but in one of 'em. The written Law for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad. <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſeethe a kid in his Mothers milk,</hi> Exod. 23.19. Now to make ſure, as they pretended, that this Law ſhould not be violated, they fenced it with this Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſeethe any fleſh whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever in any milk whatſoever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus we ſee, how very apt men are to ſet their poſts by God's Pillars, to light up their Candles to his Sun, to put their varniſh upon his Gold, and, like Botchers, to patch their inventions upon his Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The <hi>Jewiſh Rabbies,</hi> under a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous pretence of Piety, brought in whole loads of this kind of traſh, which they called
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:137166:78"/>
                     <hi>Sepimenta legis,</hi> but were indeed but <hi>impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimenta,</hi> becauſe God's Commands were thereby fruſtrated, as our Saviour Chriſt ſhows here, in the ſequel of this diſcourſe. This is the general reaſon: But</p>
                  <p>As for the particular grounds of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Traditions, I ſhall have occaſion to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſome afterwards.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 12. Thirdly, What was their Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity? Of what account they were among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and what value they put upon 'em, appears by many paſſages in their Authors. It is a ſaying of the <hi>Talmudiſts,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <hi>Verba Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balae aequiparantur verbis Legis.</hi> Here they ſet them cheek by jole (as we ſay) with the Commands of God: but this is not all; they ſet 'em even above the Law of God it ſelf, and make that to lacquey behind: for this is another ſaying in the <hi>Talmud</hi> (as <hi>Grotius</hi> quotes it) <hi>Plus eſt in verbis Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barum quam in verbis Legis; There's more weight in the words of the Scribes, than in the words of the Law.</hi> And Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> quotes another to the ſame purpoſe, <hi>The words of the Elders are more lovely than the words of the Law, and more weighty than the words of the Prophets.</hi> Hence they ſay of this Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in particular, That <hi>he that eats his bread with unwaſhen hands, ſins as grievouſly as if he lay with a Whore.</hi> So ſaith <hi>R. Joſe in
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:137166:79"/>Talm. Sota. c.</hi> 1. yea, ſaith <hi>R. Akiba, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to dye for it;</hi> and accordingly, water being once brought to him both for drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and waſhing, and the greateſt part of it being caſually ſpilt, the remainder he uſed for waſhing, ſaying, <hi>That it's better to dye, than to tranſgreſs the tradition of the Elders.</hi> And this is a ſaying too, among them. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever dwells in the land of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and eats his ordinary food after a cleanly manner, and ſpeaks in the holy language, and ſaith over his Phylacteries morning and evening, may be confident that he ſhall obtain happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the world to come.</p>
                  <p>But leſt any ſhould take theſe Traditions for matters of Counſel only, or bare opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which laid no manner of obligation upon them, and becauſe a paſſage of <hi>Grotius,</hi> formerly quoted and animadverted upon, may ſeem to look that way (though what has been ſaid already under this laſt head, does abundantly prove what an high opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion they had of them in point of their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligatorineſs) Yet further, as I ſhow'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that the word <hi>[Elder]</hi> denotes perſons of a publick Character, and ſuch as were in places of power and authority, and not only perſons in a private capacity; ſo I ſhall further prove, by ſeveral Arguments, that the Traditions of theſe Elders were not points of opinion only, but matters of injunction and command.</p>

                  <p n="8">(8) It was ſo far from that, that they pretended a particular ground from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for it, <hi>viz.</hi> that command, <hi>Levit.</hi> 15.11. <hi>Whomſoever he touches that hath the iſſue, and hath not rinſed his hands in water, he ſhall waſh

                  <p>Whereby we may perceive that this Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of theirs has the advantage of our Ceremonies, for there is no particular pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept alledged for the eſtabliſhment or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancing any of them; yea, there's little or nothing of Reaſon can be ſaid for 'em.

                  <p>Nay (Laſtly) it might ſeem to be a point of Civility, and a piece of cleanlineſs, which no doubt but both Chriſt and the Diſciples might uſe upon occaſion, though only as a matter of civility, wherein Religion was not concern'd either one way or other, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were done or not.</p>
                  <p>And this too is more than can be ſaid on the behalf of our Ceremonies; for there is no ſuch, either Decency, or Conveniency in the uſe of them.</p>
                  <p>But yet for all this Chriſt here oppoſes and condemns this Tradition, which brings me to the laſt Point to be ſpoken unto, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. And laſtly, (<hi>Sect.</hi> 17.) The Defence, Plea or Vindication that Chriſt makes in the behalf of his Diſciples in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; which is (1) by way of <hi>Retortion,</hi> or <hi>Recrimination, Why do you alſo tranſgreſs the conmand of God by your tradition,</hi> Matth. 15.3. (2) By way of <hi>Reprehenſion,</hi> or taxing them for their hypocriſie, <hi>Mark</hi> 7.6. <hi>He anſwered and ſaid unto them, VVell has Eſaias prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied of you hypocrites,</hi> &amp;c. (3) By way of <hi>Inſtruction</hi> to the people, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.10. <hi>And he called the multitude, and ſaid unto them, Hear and underſtand,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By way of <hi>Retortion,</hi> or <hi>Recrimination, VVhy do you alſo tranſgreſs the Command of God
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:137166:83"/>by your Tradition? For God commanded, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> &amp;c. They accuſe the Diſciples for tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing the Tradition of the Elders, and Chriſt accuſes them for tranſgreſſing the Command of God, by their obſerving theſe Traditions; which was certainly much more blame-worthy than the other. And here I obſerve,</p>
                  <p n="1">(1) That in thoſe words, <hi>v.</hi> 3. he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines the very foundation upon which all this tottering building of Traditions ſtood; For it was a principle among them, That the Traditions of the Elders were to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved moſt religiouſly, without any excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, contradiction, or diſpute; but now Chriſt here proves, That ſome of their Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions did palpably and evidently contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict and enterfere with the Law of God; and therefore they were not all of 'em ſo ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and inviolably to be obſerved, as they held. And then,</p>
                  <p n="2">(2) As to this particular inſtance he gives, <hi>v.</hi> 4-6. I obſerve, He does not ſo much reply to their particular queſtion, nor argue againſt this Tradition in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, which the Phariſees here ſtood up for, but chuſes rather to inſtance in one which did more evidently and by plain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence overthrow one of the Commands of God: ſo that hereby He ſeems to me plainly to intimate, and inſinuate, That all
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:137166:84"/>ſuch <hi>Traditions,</hi> i. e. <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Canons, Conſtitutions, Injunctions, and obligatory Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations,</hi> concerning <hi>unneceſſary</hi> things, (whereby men endeavour to render that practice neceſſary, which God has left free) are contrary to the Law of God, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently invalid and non-obligatory. Underſtand it, of what is not neceſſary, neither in its own <hi>Nature,</hi> nor by any <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance;</hi> according to what has been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in the foregoing Diſcourſe. Now that this is the drift of Chriſt in theſe words, I prove thus:</p>
                  <p>Either He does here by this one inſtance argue againſt, and condemn all Traditions in general, as well as this one, or he does not. If he does not, then his arguing is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent and unconcluding, as to the point in hand: For the Phariſees might reply, Well! ſuppoſe you can pick out one Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which you ſay does plainly derogate from a Command of God, yet what's that to the caſe before us? This that we implead your Diſciples for, is none of thoſe, but founded upon a particular law; and therefore that ſtands firm, and ought to be obſerved, as not liable to this exception; and ſo, they are guilty for not obſerving it. But now that Chriſt ſhould argue thus looſely and incoherently, is by no means to be admitted. Shall He who gave to man the faculty of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:137166:84"/>Reaſon, be defective in any point of Reaſon himſelf? As the Pſalmiſt argues concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God's Knowledge and Providence, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.9, 10. <hi>He that planted the ear, ſhall not he hear? He that formed the eye, ſhall he not ſee? —He that teaches man knowledge, ſhall not he know?</hi> So may we ſay in this caſe. True, the Reaſon of Chriſt's diſcourſes ſometimes lies very deep, that it's hard for us to fathom it with our ſhort underſtandings, and to attain to a clear apprehenſion of it: but however, we cannot without blaſphemy admit of any flaw in it, or deny it to be firm, valid and concluding.</p>
                  <p>But then, if He did here argue againſt all ſuch Traditions in general, my Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation ſtands good, and I have gained my Point. And hence it will follow,</p>
                  <p n="3">(3) That to obſerve ſuch Traditions, and Inſtitutions, is ſo far from being a Duty, that it is a ſin; becauſe thereby the Law of God is tranſgreſſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 18.2: Chriſt's Reply is by way of Reprehenſion, and taxing their hypocriſie, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.7-9. <hi>Ye hypocrites,</hi> &amp;c. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple indeed had a great veneration for them, and lookt upon them as great Devoto's and Religioniſts: but Chriſt puts off their vizor, uncovers their nakedneſs, and lays open their hypocriſie; and that, by applying to them
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:137166:85"/>that prophecie of <hi>Iſaiah. This people draws nigh,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>i. e.</hi> they pretend a great deal of Religion in their outward carriage, and ſeem to be very diligent in all external du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but all is but from the teeth outward: their Religion is but a meer carkaſs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any life, or ſoul, or ſpirit in it; the heart is wanting. Here he opens the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of this evil, which was, The placing all Religion in outward ceremonies, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious obſervances.</p>
                  <p>V. 9. <hi>But in vain do they worſhip me]</hi> i. e. They ſhall not only not get any good by ſuch worſhip, but ſhall bring upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the wrath of God, and conſequently a great deal of evil and miſchief, by their thus —<hi>teaching for Doctrines] i. e.</hi> inſtead of Doctrines, <hi>the commandments of men.]</hi> The word <hi>[Doctrine]</hi> is uſually taken for thoſe points either of <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Duty,</hi> which are delivered in Preaching; and here it muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, particularly, to <hi>matters of worſhip,</hi> as is evident, both becauſe that is the buſineſs in hand, which Chriſt is here ſpeaking of; and alſo, by comparing theſe words with thoſe of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> whence they are taken, <hi>viz. Iſa.</hi> 29.13. where the words run thus: <hi>—and their fear towards me is taught by the precepts of men. Their fear towards me,</hi> i. e. their worſhip of me; as <hi>fear</hi> is taken, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 17.32, 33. And then by <hi>[the commandments
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:137166:85"/>of men]</hi> is meant, thoſe <hi>Traditions of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> before mentioned; what he calls <hi>[your traditions]</hi> and <hi>[your own traditions]</hi> before, here he calls <hi>[the commandments of men.]</hi> i. e. All ſuch humane inventions and inſtitutions in God's worſhip, which have no good ground, nor warrant from the Word of God, though they may pretend ſome. <hi>Ea quae fundamentum habent in perſuaſione mere humanâ, &amp; non divinitus tradita,</hi> ſaith <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that the ſenſe of the whole clauſe is this,—<hi>Teaching for Doctrines the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of men] i. e.</hi> By their thus preaching up, and preſſing the obſervation of their Traditions and humane Inventions in the worſhip of God, inſtead of thoſe things which are of divine Inſtitution and Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they render their worſhip vain. 'Tis the property of Scripture alone to be <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for Doctrine,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.16. Hence <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> is required to <hi>ſhow uncorruptneſs in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> Tit. 2.7. <hi>i. e.</hi> to deliver the pure truths of God not daſhed with the water, nor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loy'd with the lead of humane inventions, whereby 'tis corrupted, as wine is with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and gold with lead. So that, as the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of all our Teaching is laid down <hi>Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,</hi> in that Commiſſion. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. ult. <hi>Teaching them to obſerve whatſoever I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded you:</hi> So here, teaching and urging
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:137166:86"/>any thing in the worſhip of God, not only contrary to, but beſides, the Word, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in theſe words by Chriſt; and they that take their meaſures in Worſhip, from the Commandments of men, their worſhip is vain, bootleſs, and unprofitable, yea miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous and abominable: And ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons Chriſt pronounces to be Hypocrites; and ſuch we muſt take 'em for, except we will contradict his judgement. Your zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous aſſertors of, and great ſticklers for, the obſervation of humane inventions in God's worſhip, are great hypocrites in Chriſt's account; and they that urge and impoſe ſuch things as ſtrictly, or more ſtrictly than the obſervation of divine Inſtitutions, are guilty of groſs hypocriſie, whatever they pretend, as to Decency, Uniformity, Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or the like. For, though a practice be really a matter of Decency and Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, and thereupon ſome Rules and Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions may be given by Authority about it; yet it ought not to be enjoyn'd as ſtrictly, or as much ſtreſs laid upon it, as upon the ſubſtantials and vitals of Worſhip: as for example. In point of <hi>Time,</hi> or <hi>Place,</hi> or <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,</hi> or <hi>Habit,</hi> 'tis to be ſuppoſed, and I think we may well take it for granted, that generally, neither Miniſters nor People are ſuch bruits, and ſo void of underſtanding, as to perform Duties with ſuch undue Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:137166:86"/>at ſuch inconvenient Times, in ſuch inconvenient Places, with ſuch rude Poſtures, in ſuch undecent Habits, as may render the ſervice, or worſhip notoriouſly undecent, and wholly unprofitable, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the Glory of God, and the good of Souls: or, if any particulars ſhould be guilty of ſuch foul miſcarriages, then let Governours take notice thereof, and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure offenders proportionably to the deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the crime; and not <hi>perdere ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam propter accidentia,</hi> imbroil the whole Church by, and ſilence hundreds or thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of inoffenſive Miniſters for non-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with, Impoſitions about ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Certainly the greateſt evil that can be imagin'd to follow upon ſome irregular, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due, circumſtantial miſcarriage in worſhip, is not proportionable to the thouſandth part of that miſchief which we have always found has follow'd upon theſe Impoſitions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 19. 3. The laſt method that Chriſt uſes for the Vindication of his Diſciples for their Non-conformity to this Impoſition, is by way of Inſtruction, to inform the people. What it is that really and properly does pollute a man, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.10-20. <hi>Mark</hi> 7.14-23. Where, as before he undermin'd the foundation of all their Traditions in general, ſo here he overthrows the ground-work
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:137166:87"/>of this Tradition in particular, by teaching and proving, that eating with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waſhen hands defiles not a man, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.20. and if ſo, then there's no need to waſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore meat. But this being beſides my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent deſign, I ſhall give it a diſcharge from any further attendance. And,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 20. For a cloſe of all, I ſhall wind up the ſubſtance of all that has been ſaid in a narrow compaſs. Here was (1) A <hi>Law,</hi> Precept, Injunction, Conſtitution, or call it what you will, it was ſomething they look't upon as obligatory; and that (2) made by <hi>lawful authority,</hi> yea, the Supreme authority of the Nation: and this (3) about a <hi>lawful matter,</hi> viz. that which was not anywhere forbidden by the Law of God, nor contrary to any command; yea (4) it was a matter of civil <hi>Decency:</hi> and (5) that which they pretended ſome ground from Scripture for. And yet for all this (6) this Law or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand did not oblige: for then the neglect thereof would have been blame-worthy; which yet it was not, as appears by Chriſt's Vindication of his Diſciples for it: though they did not obey this Command, nor obſerve this Cuſtom, yet he does not in the leaſt blame 'em for it. Nay,</p>
                  <p n="7">(7) The Obſervation of it upon ſuch an account, was not only not neceſſary, but
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:137166:87"/>unlawful; as appears, in that Chriſt blames and taxes the Phariſees for this and ſuch like obſervances; and therefore (Laſtly) <hi>Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity</hi> herein was ſo far from being a ſin, that it was their <hi>Duty,</hi> and <hi>Conformity</hi> or Compliance had been a ſin; from all which I infer, That</p>

                     <hi>A lawful practice, enjoyn'd by lawful Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, is not thereby, and purely on that account, made neceſſary:</hi> but there is ſomething elſe required, <hi>viz.</hi> That the matter of the law be neceſſary antecedently to the law, either in its own <hi>Nature,</hi> or in reſpect of ſome <hi>Circumſtance</hi> (as has been ſhewed in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going diſcourſe about <hi>Indifferencies</hi>), or elſe it obliges not.</p>
